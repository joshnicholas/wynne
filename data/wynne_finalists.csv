I love the light, energy and spacial qualities of this environment. I think that there are visual cues that alter our breathing. Architectural structures like gothic cathedrals and mosques affect us psychologically and physically, giving us a sense of wonder and exaltation. Often I have observed people looking at a beautiful vista. They will breathe in deeply, raise their arms and clasp their hands behind their heads. I think that by doing this, more oxygen goes into the brain, which highlights our senses and intensifies our perceptions.

The dunce – I will learn the rules before I speak is part of an ongoing body of sculptures and ink drawings depicting flights of fantasy that blur the lines between traditional and non-traditional art methods. This possible self-portrait has its origins in a series of ink drawings made after Goya’s Los caprichos print series. I had these images hanging around in the studio for two years and decided to convert them into three-dimensional forms, to make a new body of work.

What I wanted to get to was a unified presence, full and ordered with a light and clarity of its own. Intensively worked, scraped back repeatedly, and reconsidered, Crossgrain is not a painting about texture. Nor is the image trying to create a special illusion of a representative world – though if you want to think in terms of earth, air, the soft steps of the sky, it is all of those things. I think of Crossgrain more as a space where mood, movement, vibration, the linkages of marks across the surface and their special behaviour form a particular experience.

However, he went on to paint several significant original oils of this iconic subject. In my work, the waterfall somehow embodies the fleeting and mysterious nature of life. The waters of Strath Creek, after all, come from the catchments around Mount Disappointment [in Victoria].

My paintings deal with the tensions and dichotomies in both the depiction of the natural world and our relationship to it.

I use this term as opposed to ‘inorganic data’, which would be data produced solely inside software. ‘Organic data’ is taken from life and digitised by a scanning process.

Kosciuszko, snowgums and puddles is a synthesis of my visits to the Snowy Mountains. It is a place, which remains clear in my mind: the gums, the unpredictable, threatening weather, and the puddles formed from melted snow.

Here I found an almost subliminal familiarity or sense of place. It made sense to stop here, to literally pull off the road and sketch. It’s nothing special; it’s no man’s land. But as we pass through, our knowledge of these places accumulates, and it accounts for most of what we know and feel of the landscape.

In The island is a mighty fortress , the island looms large as a symbol of life’s struggle, both menacing and beautiful, with the various infrastructure indicating possible pathways toward the top. I want the viewer to explore each of these options and find his or her own way to reach the summit, symbolising our need to each find our own answers to life’s questions.

I spent time there, visited the studs, went up in a helicopter and was able to see the extent of the mining. I staged an exhibition at Michael Reid’s gallery in Murrurundi of work about the mining as well as the area in general. The mine was stopped – though my exhibition had no influence in that.

The plant sends out long tendrils that can spread out up to three metres and produces large, white, edible tubers, similar to the common sweet potato. The bush potato vine grows after the rains. The women go out to collect the potato using crowbars to dig up the ground. Once collected, they are cooked in the hot coals of the fire.

From this experience and memories, I arrived at the bare bones of the image. The execution of the painting is where the making really happens. I use the tools of spontaneity, accident, chance and improvisation. Watercolour is an ideal medium for this as it dries quickly, can be applied quickly and has a fresh, lively, colourful feel.

I pondered the difficulties, even the peculiarity, of painting the Australian landscape. Why even do it anymore? For being in the bush is nothing like being before even the most faithful painting of it. I can’t hope to obtain the deep connection Indigenous owners have to their land. Yet I do respond to this land and love it; I want to protect it, not exploit it. How could I paint all this? So I determined to pour paint over our native flora, to ‘paint it’, literally.

2013,Philip Wolfhagen,Thirteenth journey,oil and beeswax on linen,"Thirteenth journey is a tribute to the 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain. All landscape painters pay homage to Claude at some point. There is a very good example to be found at the Gallery in the small room off the James Fairfax Galleries, in a lovingly painted copy of a Claude: Landscape with goatherd and goats , after Claude 1823, by John Constable (another of my heroes). Although clearly my painting is not a copy, I am interested in Claude’s use of dark masses of foreground foliage – rather like a stage set – and the luminosity of his light. In my painting the foliage on the right belongs to our native Allocasuarina , opposed by the white skeletons of dead eucalyptus. - Philip Wolfhagan",False,data/images/2013_Philip Wolfhagen_Thirteenth journey.jpg,2013_Philip Wolfhagen_Thirteenth journey,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29428/

He thought they were superior; their ability to survive second to none. We would hitch rides on boats and barges up past Bar Island with ‘Lofty’, a river-man who taught us where to collect mud oysters and how to open them in the hot coals at the edge of the fire.

Influenced by an array of philosophies including Kandinsky, Buddhist meditation and Chinese calligraphy, I am interested in using paint to capture the intangible, the emotive and the transcendental. My intention is to create a sense of space and stillness that embraces the viewer in a contemplative moment, and provides an opportunity for the viewer to explore their own inner landscape. - Annie Hsiao-Wen Wang",False,data/images/2013_Annie Hsiao-Wen Wang_Conversations _IV_.jpg,2013_Annie Hsiao-Wen Wang_Conversations _IV_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29426/

It is like their family home, their roots. Our clan is also named Kirriwirri. Kirriwirri is a jila (living water) near Well 33 on the Canning Stock Route in the Great Sandy Desert. It is important to many other family and clan groups because it has water that never dries out even in the driest of seasons. My painting reflects the complex desert landscape full of life and colour. It depicts salt lakes (the white areas) and the talis (sand hills).

It is an area relatively new to me as a subject. I generally concentrate my compositions on places in and around the Southern Highlands of NSW , such as Robertson and Kangaroo Valley.

Through his watercolours of Central Australia, Namatjira found a way to repair some of the psychic and spiritual damage – what Kevin Gilbert has called ‘a rape of the soul’ – long endured by Aboriginal Australia. His body of work is an art of healing and is the antecedent to the Papunya Tula art movement, which emerged unexpectedly in the early 1970s, paving the way for the blossoming of contemporary art in its myriad forms today. - Imants Tillers",True,data/images/2013_Imants Tillers_Namatjira.jpg,2013_Imants Tillers_Namatjira,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29422/

This is a figure of passive resistance. While modeled on my own body, the identity of the figure is ambiguous. Its anonymity evokes questions regarding the act of identification and of being watched.

But on another level the question is: ‘What will happen here when the host is outgrown?’ This work is a frozen moment in a narrative, a question, which has no answer. Does the growth overrun the entire gallery and everything around it? Or are the tiny colonies doomed, unable to sustain further growth by themselves? Is an equilibrium possible? I like my works to start a conversation with the viewer – the work starts to resonate through that flow.

2013,Theo Papathomas,Figures dancing,mixed media,"I don’t find landscape a pure and unmediated experience, or think of it as an unchanging phenomenon, but rather a shifting, dynamic relationship between the animate and inanimate. So in my paintings nothing appears fixed. All exists in a charged dialectical exchange of light and dark, benevolence and the malign, repose and energy. In formal terms, my painting possesses the fluidity and abandonment of dance. For me this constitutes the dance of nature itself with its apparent endless, alternating states of tranquility and the cataclysmic, never more apparent than in the geography of our contemporary, apocalyptic present with its destructive threat of global warming. As an essentially intuitive painter my paintings are never vehicles for unambiguous messages – but barometers of our preoccupations and dilemmas. - Theo Papathomas",False,data/images/2013_Theo Papathomas_Figures dancing.jpg,2013_Theo Papathomas_Figures dancing,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29416/

Referencing Charles Darwin, ‘blossom’ as noun, verb and title speaks of the natural world, the strongest surviving to flourish and continue.

From my first glimpse of it 12 years ago, I have fallen in love with this view and have painted it many times. This painting was executed en plein air in oils and took just over two hours to finish. Rather than trying to describe or illustrate its splendour, this time I willfully attempted to reinvent its form, space and light; the nearer to cleave to it.

Rising 600 metres out of the sea, it is the largest single volcanic stack on Earth. The rest of this enormous crater has been completely eroded away over the last seven million years. To attempt to understand the forces at work capable of wearing such a structure to nothing is impossible. To attempt to make a painting about it also seems futile, but this remnant of the forming of the Earth became an obsession and something I needed to conquer.

The park is probably my favourite space in Sydney. It’s large and an interesting design with more than 100 years of history.

About six years ago I was awarded a residency at Arthur Boyd’s property in Bundanon that he bequeathed to the nation. It was the beginning of an enduring relationship with the landscape there. The property is set at the end of a long single-track dirt road. It is a sprawling space that edges onto the Shoalhaven River. It is a landscape that I was familiar with before I went there through looking at Boyd’s painting The expulsion , part of a biblical-themed series, set in the forests on the property, and his Shoalhaven paintings of boulders on a sandy river.

For most of the year it is nothing more than dry stones and cracked mud. However, scattered along its way are a few small (semi) permanent waterholes. These provide vital yet precarious relief and nourishment for a great variety of life forms. In this painting I wanted to describe the way the creek meanders through and around the burnt tree stumps and Livistonia palms as if slivering its way down to the greater water source of Berry Springs, seeking its own form of nourishment.

Usually it was bone dry but there were rare instances of flooding when Back Creek became a torrent and we’d be unable to get to school. However, Back Creek as a source of inspiration is really only a starting point. As with most of my work, the subject comes second to the process of painting. In the painting, there is a flat area of land in the foreground beyond which the creek’s path is delineated by a suggestion of tree shapes. The remainder is a fairly dramatic sky pressing down and pervading the image with the effect of what could be a hot summer’s day.

The landscape has been my main subject and source of inspiration for over 15 years. However, for the first time I am completely noticing the trees. I see them as stunning shapes and contrasting colours, fitting together like a huge jigsaw puzzle into the landscape. To me this painting is a calm, tranquil place.

Salt drifts on the sea breeze rattling shards of foliage overhead and Casuarina swamp oaks drone and purr. Wave the nasty March flies away before they bite, and run from the midge clouds. Life is an unruly tangle of matter and light. With untidy beginnings, temporal clarity can be found amongst the clutter of its duration before a messy end.

2013,Elisabeth Cummings,"Sunrise, the Kimberley",oil on canvas,"I was on a painting trip at the Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary in the Kimberley last year and one of the most memorable experiences was being high up on an escarpment to watch the sunrise. My painting is an attempt to give a sense of the wide majestic landscape being suffused by the early morning light – the mountains and mesas in the distance and the complexity of tree-covered hills, rocky outcrops and gorges stretching before me.

2013,Dale Cox,Tract 17,acrylic on canvas,"Fire is an integral and essential aspect of the Australian environment. Over millions of years our dry eucalyptus forests have been forged in fire. They are quite literally ‘designed’ to burn. With bushfire comes regeneration. Many native species have evolved specifically to exploit the opportunities fire creates to renew forest and open woodlands. In isolating the landmass, putting the viewer at a distinct vantage, I accentuate both the land’s monumental and immoveable aspects as well as its vulnerability. The layers of geological strata suggest the here-and-now to be little more than skin deep, the fleeting, frailness of ‘now’ upon a shifting geology of restless change. - Dale Cox",False,data/images/2013_Dale Cox_Tract 17.jpg,2013_Dale Cox_Tract 17,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29400/

The painting was completed in the studio, using a number of drawings done on location as source material. While drawing late one afternoon I was struck by the look of the bridge, in dark silhouette, appearing to merge with the dark land mass and have tried to get some sense of this in the work. The sky, land and water areas are painted in broad washes of thin oil paint. In contrast, the lines that form the struts of the bridge set up dark accents across the painting. I have left the work in a relatively undeveloped state in the hope that it may suggest the freshness and spontaneity of the sketch that inspired it. - David Collins This work was highly commended by the Wynne Prize 2013 judges.",True,data/images/2013_David Collins_Hawkesbury crossing.jpg,2013_David Collins_Hawkesbury crossing,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2013/29399/

The work, which merges traditional and contemporary perspectives and practices, displays the versatility of the art of Chinese brush painting. As one of the oldest art forms in the world, Chinese brush painting is practised globally and is alive and well in Australia, evolving as an integral part of Australia’s multicultural art milieu.

The watercolour and graphite drawing Glyphs and moon is one such meditation where each form has a specific genesis in the Australian landscape.

I used brilliant vermillion to capture how the sun reveals the tree and makes it seem almost on fire. The foreground of the painting is composed of shadows, which dramatise these first rays of light. Gradually, as the light grows more dazzling, the shadows take shape, showing the great beauty of each wildflower.

In this series I have endeavoured to liberate my paintings from the expectation that they represent a particular place. Although they are based on observations of real places, what is represented is entirely constructed. I believe the process of painting should be one of constant enquiry. It matters more ‘how’ a thing is represented, than ‘what’ is represented. It puts more emphasis on the act of painting itself, the poetry of execution, the emotional power of the medium. - Philip Wolfhagen, 2014",True,data/images/2014_Philip Wolfhagen_Landscape reinvention no_ 17.jpg,2014_Philip Wolfhagen_Landscape reinvention no_ 17,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2014/29560/

I like to use Australian landforms, flora and fauna, some architectural references, traces of human habitation (ancient and modern), some political and social commentary, and see where it leads. Using these elements I like to set up rhythms and harmonies within the work – this might be through the use of colour, repetitive shapes or forms, angles and curves, or a combination of all these.

I was really struck by how deep a trench the Darling River forms at that location. There is something about a river, which is sometimes so big and powerful that it can carve such a deep-sided trench, and yet is often close to empty – as it was when we visited. It is that sense of extravagance: bare, eroded and very steep banks that never support plant growth because they are either under flood or too dry, that was the genesis of this painting. - John R Walker, 2014",True,data/images/2014_John R Walker_The Darling at Kalyanka.jpg,2014_John R Walker_The Darling at Kalyanka,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2014/29558/

No matter how beautiful the setting, those who don’t fit the mould can be subject to ridicule, intimidation and even physical abuse. Sadly, this can result in suicide. Nearly 600 young people aged between 15 and 30 took their lives last year.

Changes began to happen in my way of painting as my paint thinned and I became aware that I was trying to evoke a further level of depth and clarity, while following a line of greater economy – opening up a more ventilated space between the layers of paint.

It draws on other journeys in this region, especially around Castra, and conflates these with histories of fraught colonial settlement, local newspaper accounts of first homebuyers and their acquisition of land and aspirations for the future. The painting takes these complex, diverse layers of connection to Tasmania, ranging across personal experience, historical fact and anecdotal narrative and merges them together to form a visual account of the intricately subtle, emotive landscape of migratory experience. - Neil Haddon, 2014",False,data/images/2014_Neil Haddon_The trees at Castra _first time_.jpg,2014_Neil Haddon_The trees at Castra _first time_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2014/29533/

In those flat lands, I have found the landscape to suit my painting style rather than the other way round. I’ve been working with wide brush strokes in horizontals, with a few daubs, to capture the grainfields and the tracery of access roads through the blocks of land. Because it’s irrigated dry land, I have to paint from the dirt up to get that light feeling of the grass on top.

By revitalising old traditions, I provide Australians with a fresh perspective of their trees and country. The great ‘Australian landscape’ tradition, once emblematic of the Eurocentric vision of Australia, has now embraced Indigenous views of the landscape. It will be further strengthened when Asian artistic perspectives join in.

Back in the studio, I blocked in a large portion of the painting over a couple of days of 40-degree summer heat. It was a type of meditation, no sketching, no mapping, working intuitively with broad brush marks for the ironbarks and lyrical calligraphic line work for saplings. Thin washes and thick swathes create a very tactile, frontal view of the sharply rising hillside. The trees are almost figurative. I wanted to make a story about their restlessness.

The trees initially seem straightforward enough but are filled with tension and movement. Nature is shown as an elemental force – the inexhaustible source of life. On another level it refers to the tree of life, a theme used in Christian iconography through the crucifixion and the sacrifice we will all experience. By being born we will die. The work pays homage to Rembrandt’s etching The three trees 1643, which deals with the same eternal theme in a Dutch landscape. - GW Bot, 2014",True,data/images/2014_G W Bot_Glyphs _ three trees _homage to Rembrandt_.jpg,2014_G W Bot_Glyphs _ three trees _homage to Rembrandt_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2014/29525/

Together with many older ladies I learned Australian landscape painting on a Saturday morning. I wanted to paint willow trees but Mr Scott said they were too difficult and un-Australian. I sometimes feel a little this way myself. Always elegantly mirrored on some body of water, willow trees such as the magnificent specimens surrounding Canberra’s Lake Burley Griffin fascinate me.

These main plant types are complemented by the warm gray tones of the weathered Jurassic dolerite that forms the substrate.

Across the same field, drovers herded cattle to the abattoir at Belongil Beach, and whalers at season’s end exited the region. Belongil Field has always been a place through which people move.

I don’t attempt to paint a clear representation of the area but take from everywhere. Then, back in my bushland studio, I reassemble the memories much like a jigsaw into a simplified and emotional interpretation of the beauty that surrounds me.

Each expressive line is a once-only combination of deliberate gesture and chance. These processes combine to create the bush view before you. The paint itself, with its delicious buttery texture, provides the spatial depth. Then, drawing into the paint develops anecdotal and tactile forms on the surface.

These paintings are about time past and the promise of slowing down in the future; the anticipation, contemplation, sunlight and shadows, still salt air and silent static moments. Approaching the landscape as a living vessel of memory, the work considers how certain places conjure images from the past, tempered with the transient shadow of the present. They express personal embedded ideas about my own experiences of place and of those that have been here before.

It is a dry area, but its evocative colour, dynamic shapes and rugged lyricism make it lush to the painter’s eye. This particular location was close to our lodgings. The intriguing interplay between the slopes exudes many different moods in the course of a day, but none more dramatic than late afternoon, when a haze seems to fuse the distant hills.

There is so much to learn and discover. With this in mind, I created Implexis (‘interwined’ in Latin) based on the four seasons as I know them – summer, autumn, winter and spring – and intertwined them with the six seasons from the Indigenous D’harawal calendar – Burran, Marrai’gang, Burrugin, Wiritjiribin, Ngoonungi and Parra’dowee. Hidden throughout the painting are D’harawal flora and fauna that suggest the change of season. There are also Indigenous words, while the river glides seamlessly through the landscape with sea creatures.

2022,Clara Adolphs,Christmas cloud,oil on jute,"I began painting clouds as a kind of backdrop for my figurative works, although they soon revealed themselves as the centrepiece. They are figurative beings, towering and monumental. Their formations are in a state of constant flux. The painting is one moment in their time of continuous change. This particular cloud, a Cumulus congestus, was painted from a formation accumulating on the afternoon of Christmas Day, 2021. These clouds bring rain and unsettled weather, but from afar it was a perfect day.

2023,John R Walker,Vinbana-Yura-Mulka (Breakneck Gorge) I,oil on polyester,"John R Walker has regularly visited the northern Flinders Ranges, on Adnyamathanha Country in South Australia, since 2016. The gorge depicted in this work runs through a belt of ancient, twisted rock – an area that amazed the artist for its geological complexity and variation. ‘Breakneck Gorge is not a place that initially took my attention. It is quiet and a bit neglected; however, it had begun to haunt me,’ says Walker, a 15-time finalist in the Wynne. ‘The painting almost took me by surprise. I had started working on a canvas and suddenly realised what it was. I then asked Adnyamathanha artist Kristian Coulthard for the correct name for this place: Vinbana-Yura-Mulka.’ Walking extensively across the ranges making drawings with gouache to capture the timeless spirit of the Country, Walker later made this painting flat on the floor of his Braidwood studio in the NSW Southern Tablelands, on Walbanga Country.",False,data/images/2023_John R Walker_Vinbana-Yura-Mulka _Breakneck Gorge_ I.jpg,2023_John R Walker_Vinbana-Yura-Mulka _Breakneck Gorge_ I,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30603/
2024,Louise Zhang,Tapestry: lotus,synthetic polymer paint on canvas,"A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Louise Zhang was inspired to record her experiences of sitting by the lotus pond in Sydney’s Royal Botanic Garden, located on Gadigal land. The work stems from a practice of ‘slowing down and simply being,’ Zhang explains, with the act of painting offering an opportunity for reflection and providing solace. Found at the harbour end of the gardens, the pond is a site that Zhang has enjoyed since childhood. In this painting, Zhang imbues the ancient Chinese symbol of the lotus with a pop sensibility. Flourishes of purple–pink coalesce around a focal point that frames a blossoming lotus – a flower traditionally associated with elegance, longevity and other virtues. ‘I’ve reflected deeply on the concept of an “Australian landscape”,’ Zhang says. ‘My artwork has been interpreted in this context before but was never fully recognised as “Australian”, like me. I see my experiences with our landscape as inherently “Australian” and intertwined with my Chinese–Australian heritage.’",False,data/images/2024_Louise Zhang_Tapestry_ lotus.jpg,2024_Louise Zhang_Tapestry_ lotus,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30726/
2024,Christopher Zanko,Personal plethoras,synthetic polymer paint on hand-carved wood,"Growing up, Christopher Zanko formed impressions of local architecture that helped him build a ‘cognitive map’. Particular houses and streets in the Wollongong suburbs of his childhood, on Dharawal land, became markers for him in a place now undergoing development and gentrification. Zanko, a two-time Wynne finalist, noticed this house while walking to his daughter’s preschool in 2023. ‘The arrangement of shadows cast by the eaves and the glimpse into the backyard gave a sense of familiarity,’ he says. Rendered large, with confident lines, the house’s textures of red brick, speckled concrete, pruned bushes and drawn blinds have been lovingly depicted. Zanko carves into the wooden surface with small hand chisels before adding colour, then accentuates the work’s graphic details and deep shadows by applying black paint with a roller. While the changing nature of our environment can be challenging, Zanko notes, it ‘is arguably necessary, especially considering Australia’s current housing crisis’. ‘Through my process I seek to give a sense of permanency to the narratives and experiences of suburban Australia.’",False,data/images/2024_Christopher Zanko_Personal plethoras.jpg,2024_Christopher Zanko_Personal plethoras,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30725/
2024,Djakaŋu Yunupiŋu,Nyalala gurmilili,natural pigments on bark,"Depicted here is the miwatj, or ‘sunrise side’ in Yolŋu Matha. It relates to the north-easternmost part of Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, that receives the first light as the sun rises in the east. This is the landscape during April and the start of Miḏawarr (the harvest season following the wet), when the earth receives sudden surprise showers during what is meant to be the dry. Djakaŋu Yunupiŋu, a first-time Wynne finalist, paints lore connected to the beach at Garriri/Rocky Bay, through songs gifted to her by her father, renowned artist Muŋgurrawuy Yunupiŋu. It refers to the tale of the Djulpan, a group of Yirritja spirit women who are a constellation – the Pleiades. These are the seven sisters, who come together to gather food. They then retreat over the northern horizon to their homes. If fires are lit before these celestial movements take place, the Djulpan become sad and cry, as is evident in this painting.

2024,Frank Young,Kulata punu,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This is Watarru, a site in the south-west of the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands where the kulata tree grows abundantly among rocky outcrops and tali (sandhills). There is a distinct punu (wood) that first-time Wynne Prize finalist Frank Young uses to craft kulata (spears). This is a special skill, shared from grandfather to grandson, and has been championed in recent years by the Tjilpies (senior men) from across the Lands as part of the Kulata tjuta (many spears) project. This initiative was originally conceived by the Amata community and its artistic outcomes have been seen across national and international exhibitions. Young is recognised for his pairing of flattened landscapes and two-dimensional objects with Pitjantjatjara text. Often used as a framing device, the language in this work recounts both the Wanampi and spear tjukurpa, along with methods of crafting kulata. This is a laborious process that includes cutting and burning the punu, wrapping the sharpened head with kangaroo or emu sinew, and binding it with a resin made from mulga or spinifex.",False,data/images/2024_Frank Young_Kulata punu.jpg,2024_Frank Young_Kulata punu,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30723/
2024,Kunmanara (Tiger) Yaltangki,Kitar,synthetic polymer paint on wood,"Tiger Yaltangki’s fantastical works often explore the divergent influences that have shaped his world view, offering a unique image of life in Indulkana on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia. As Yaltangki is largely non-verbal, his art practice also represents a vital form of self-expression. Yaltangki’s oversized and exaggerated electric kitar (‘guitar’ as spelt and pronounced in Pitjantjatjara/Yankunytjatjara) draws on the artist’s love for music, particularly classic rock bands Creedence Clearwater Revival and AC/DC. This form has become a recurring motif within Yaltangki’s practice, alongside the words ‘ ROCK N ROLL’, which hover over an abstract topography of colour. On the alternate face of the kitar, a humanoid form emerges. This is Mamu, an Aṉangu spirit person or creature. This is the first time Yaltangki has been selected as a Wynne Prize finalist.",False,data/images/2024_Kunmanara _Tiger_ Yaltangki_Kitar.jpg,2024_Kunmanara _Tiger_ Yaltangki_Kitar,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30722/
2024,John West Tjupurrula,Untitled,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"A few years ago, John West Tjupurrula took his first helicopter trip. ‘Seeing my Country from above changed my style, and now I paint my Country that way,’ he says. Using photographs and drone footage as source material, Tjupurrula has painted an aerial view of Palipalintja, a site of swamps and rock holes, found just west of Jupiter Well in Western Australia. ‘I chose colours that reminded me of the landscape at that place.’ Tjupurrula’s mottled fields of colour reveal the path taken by a large group of Tingari men who camped at this place while on their journey to Kiwirrkurra in the distant past. The events associated with the Tingari cycle are restricted knowledge, yet the adventures of these ancestral beings are enshrined in songlines. As the son of two recognised artists who worked through Papunya Tula Artists, Freddy West Tjakamarra and Payu Napaltjarri, the first-time Wynne finalist appreciates the importance of documenting cultural knowledge through art and sharing it with younger generations.",False,data/images/2024_John West Tjupurrula_Untitled.jpg,2024_John West Tjupurrula_Untitled,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30720/
2024,Bobby West Tjupurrula,Untitled,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"‘I wanted to paint this work for the Wynne Prize and I wanted it to be big,’ explains Bobby West Tjupurrula. ‘I imagined the place, Palipalintja. I can see it when I close my eyes,’ he says, speaking about a location for which he is a senior custodian. In this painting, Tjupurrula has captured Country in a mesmerising hypnotic form. His idiosyncratic visual language of multidirectional chevrons reverberates from and demarcates important sites that relate to the actions of the Tingari around the area of Palipalintja in Western Australia. Ancestral figures, the Tingari travelled over vast stretches of the Western Desert in the distant past, with their actions and interactions shaping Country. Tjupurrula is a leading artist and member of Papunya Tula Artists, where his father Freddy West Tjakamarra was a founding member. This is his first time as a finalist in the Wynne Prize.

2024,Robyn Sweaney,Little by little,synthetic polymer paint on canvas,"Robyn Sweaney has always been drawn to the exteriors of modestly sized Australian homes. This painting of a permanent caravan site in Wooli Holiday Park captures a slice of life in the unassuming northern NSW coastal town on Bundjalung Country, a few hours south of the artist’s home in Murwillumbah. Struck by the poignant contradiction of a ‘permanent’ caravan, Sweaney observes that these converted dwellings demonstrate ‘resourcefulness, adaptation and a human need for close connection to the landscape and others within it’. She documents a carefully placed blue vase and row of chairs, hinting at the communal outdoor life of the home’s absent owners. In the face of modern dilemmas like homelessness and a national housing crisis, Sweaney considers what a home is or could be.

As a young woman, she found work at the nearby Erldunda Station, where her father also worked as a stockman. Sundown regularly paints this imposing desert landscape, dominated by sand dunes and spinifex grass. ‘Nganana rawangku inkapai mangka-mangkangka, kutin-kutinkatinyi,’ says Sundown, detailing how, while collecting milkweed, she and her siblings would often playfully tumble down a sand dune and roll to the bottom. Evident from her use of colour and the marks she makes, Sundown has portrayed a changing landscape, reflecting how the tiniest particles of Country shift and move.

Son’s larger-than-life Dancing teddy toys with this perception, incorporating swaying limbs, a camera for an eye, and a monitor displaying a live video feed of its onlookers. The dancing sculpture imitates the movement of South Korean ‘broadcast jockeys’: the term used for live streamers on the country’s popular video-streaming platform AfreecaTV. In South Korea – where pornography is banned – molka or ‘hidden camera’ crimes are rife. Women are often the targets of these illegal cameras, concealed in bathrooms and other public places. For Son, the ‘cam girl’ streamers who dance for online spectators claim their agency in the context of an often invasive and patriarchal culture. ‘The bear serves as a performer on my behalf,’ says Son, a first-time Wynne finalist. With its themes of attention and surveillance, the work taps into both desire and anxiety: the impulse ‘to be seen, and the fear of being forgotten’.",False,data/images/2024_EJ Son_Dancing teddy.jpg,2024_EJ Son_Dancing teddy,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30718/

As it fills and recedes it transforms in a mercurial way from a series of ordinary looking sheep paddocks to a shimmering wetland teeming with birdlife.’ The lake is close to Kamberri/Canberra, with its north-western edge meeting the Federal Highway en route to Goulburn and Sydney. Sciberras remembers it as always being on his radar. On each approach, he would wonder how the perpetually changing lake might appear. A five-time Wynne Prize finalist, Sciberras recalls catching the train from Campbelltown to the city as a teenager to view the Wynne, which he regarded as ‘the most painterly inspiration I could find’.",False,data/images/2024_Luke Sciberras_Autumn light_ Lake George_Werriwa.jpg,2024_Luke Sciberras_Autumn light_ Lake George_Werriwa,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30716/

With its title quoting the commonly used expression ‘possession is nine-tenths of the law’, Ross’s painting refers to British colonial possession of an already inhabited land. Ross references the watercolours of colonial painter Joseph Lycett in this landscape, which is further transformed by hi-vis yellow and neon pink – synthetic colours that command attention, especially when applied to the natural world. ‘There is a greed about colonising someone else’s land, an agreed greed that continues today and a lack of sensitivity to the original inhabitants of this land and the land itself,’ says Ross. ‘Whenever I am in the bush I see signs of humans making their mark on nature. I see graffiti tags on rocks, I see love and hate, political messages, personal tags, swear words, initials and love hearts. There is a disconnection with nature and a self-centredness that defies care.’ Winner of the Sulman Prize in 2017, Ross is a two-time Wynne Prize finalist.

Yalpirakinu is also referred to as Yuelamu. Robertson consistently paints this site to maintain his deep connection to the earth and engage with memories of family by documenting the desert mountains, ridges and trees. Working with a restricted colour palette, Robertson loads his brushwork with energy. He pushes and pulls his colour, reworking the image until it is complete. The influence of his mentor, the late Billy Benn Perrurle, is particularly evident within this painting. Recently, Robertson has been experimenting with depicting Yalpirakinu within a frame, as if he is looking through a window and viewing Country from afar. Robertson is a long-standing member of Bindi Mwerre Anthurre Artists, working through the studio since 2002.

2024,Jude Rae,The miracle of the trees,oil on canvas,"This painting by two-time Wynne finalist Jude Rae was inspired by a regenerating bush landscape at Mount Wilson in the Blue Mountains region of NSW . Mount Wilson is close to the site of the Gospers Mountain fire, part of the devastating ‘mega-blaze’ that blanketed the state with smoke in late 2019. Having lived in the Blue Mountains area as a child, Rae was unnerved during a visit to Mount Wilson in 2023 when she experienced ‘the burnt remains of the treetops snapping off in high winds and falling on the car.’ In the painting, a deep orange underlayer provides a menacing reminder of the destruction wrought by fire. But green plumes of epicormic foliage – a fire-adaptive trait of eucalypts – blossom over blackened trunks. ‘It is a meditation on this miraculous phenomenon in the context of climate change,’ says Rae. The work’s striking vertical composition suggests a transcendent quality to the trees’ regeneration.",False,data/images/2024_Jude Rae_The miracle of the trees.jpg,2024_Jude Rae_The miracle of the trees,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30713/
2024,Jason Phu,my really beautiful wonderful city wow,synthetic polymer paint on canvas,"This painting by Jason Phu is an unmistakable ode to Sydney. ‘I spend a lot of time in the city,’ says the two-time Wynne finalist and 2015 Sulman Prize winner. He explains the painting’s origins: ‘I remember once, a man attempted to dodge a bull made of bronze the size of a small truck, only to be seen later picking up his bloodied teeth from the sidewalk. I remember rivers of thick mustard ammonia flowing from sandstone walls. I remember little tiny cups of glowing liquid in blue, green or pink that fuelled the cars and people alike. I remember the deep hum and thump of giants in walls of slime and salt. I remember light’s pinpoint accuracy of sharp green lasers becoming blurry tear-speckled lights of red and blue. Oh wild prophets shouting my great-grandmother’s place of birth and their mother’s before that, before expelling their stomach’s contents to divinate. This all on a rainy Saturday eve.’",False,data/images/2024_Jason Phu_my really beautiful wonderful city wow.jpg,2024_Jason Phu_my really beautiful wonderful city wow,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30712/

It is a site of significance for Thea Anamara Perkins, a two-time Wynne finalist who is also exhibiting in this year’s Archibald Prize. This is where her grandfather Charles Perkins was born and where he rests, and where her great-grandmother Hetty Perkins worked. The seductive beauty of Perkins’s work, with its atmospheric evocations of burnished light, draws viewers into a tender trap set to expose the looming threats of climate inaction. ‘Beauty can be a vehicle to convey hard truths,’ she says. ‘I chose to paint last light as time is running out. I’m communicating the essence of a place that I hold dear to prompt others to think of what we value.’ Thus, this painting, which echoes the energetic rhythms of landscape, becomes a portrait of the people connected to it. As Perkins explains, ‘Country is family.’",False,data/images/2024_Thea Anamara Perkins_Atherreyurre.jpg,2024_Thea Anamara Perkins_Atherreyurre,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30711/
2024,Sassy Park,Man with sore finger,stoneware and glaze,"‘ Man with sore finger memorialises the events of a DIY home repair accident where my partner cut his finger using a circular saw. Without saying a word, this resourceful and independent man left the house to walk up to the local hospital, returning with his arm in a sling and a bandaged finger,’ explains Sassy Park, a first-time Wynne finalist. This intimate sculpture references terracotta figurines from Greece and Rome and the 18th- and 19th-century statuettes known as Staffordshire figures – ceramic animals and people designed for display in English homes. In deliberate contrast to larger works of heroic statuary, Park is drawn to more empathetic, small-scale commemorations of everyday events. Modelled in clay at the artist’s studio on Gadigal land in Sydney, this sculpture was glazed and fired multiple times over months to achieve Park’s desired effect. The final surface retains marks of the artist’s fingers and her shaping process. ‘It is a practice full of expectations, disappointments and serendipity,’ she says. ‘The vulnerability of the beloved resonates with the idea of ceramics itself.’",False,data/images/2024_Sassy Park_Man with sore finger.jpg,2024_Sassy Park_Man with sore finger,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30710/

As well as being a stockman, my father-in-law was a wonderful musician, and a great artist who painted his memories. I’ve painted him on Country, with his guitar and a wild horse running free.’ In addition to presenting this moving tribute, Namatjira has captured the serenity of Indulkana Ridge, not far from Indulkana in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia. Namatjira’s stylistic conventions draw on the legacy of landscape watercolour painting, as championed by his famous great-grandfather Albert Namatjira, to create a singular vision of Country that is both harsh and imposing yet rendered with affection and dense with meaning.

First-time Wynne Prize finalist Barayuwa Munuŋgurr is the Djuŋgayi (cultural guardian) for this place. Depicted is the ancient Munyuku clan story that comes from Country, enshrined in manikay (song poetry) that recounts the events that shape the essence of Yarrinya and the ancestral powers that reside here. Between the bands of miny’tji (sacred clan designs), pulsing and choppy sacred saltwater flows and a reef emerges.

She is almost four and the magpies run up to us on the street to this day.’ McLauchlan has contact- and screen-printed, stitched, and embellished Wiradjuri Country – Wagga Wagga, where she currently resides. While a guest to these lands, her work captures the importance of home, and celebrates the strong Wiradjuri Elders who have held on to culture. McLauchlan says that this work is also an ode to the guardians who watch over her daughter: the magpie who sings to her in the daytime, and the possum who watches over her at night. The materiality of the work also purposefully complicates the history of Aboriginal and European settler relations across the southeast of Australia.

When Noel McKenna visited Cape Pillar many years ago, he was struck by the sense that it was untouched by human presence and observed ‘a stillness which borders on ancient’. McKenna’s rose-coloured palette and simplified forms lend a poetic quality to the landscape, where a lone figure is dwarfed by the clifftop on which she stands. ‘One often sees this dramatic scene where the coastline meets the sea, sometimes with a perpendicular drop down to the water,’ McKenna explains. ‘This scene is done through my memory, the sailboat the only evidence of humankind.’ This is McKenna’s 27th time as a finalist in the Wynne Prize.

It was her father who introduced the plant to Lee, teaching her about its various parts, which have been harvested and used by Aboriginal peoples since time immemorial. She also was taught that xanthorrhoeas were once derogatorily referred to as ‘black boys’. While this term is rarely used today, it has informed how Lee views the evolving nature of language, and her desire to rework traces of colonialism into figurative forms rooted in cultural knowledge. ‘My ongoing body of work transforms these fraudulent books into a pyrophytic plant which thrives under deconstruction and reconstruction,’ she says.",False,data/images/2024_Jenna Mayilema Lee_Grass tree _at rest_.jpg,2024_Jenna Mayilema Lee_Grass tree _at rest_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30705/

For this work, Kulyuru has painted her mother’s Country, the area of Watarru, found in the south-western corner of the Lands. ‘I teach my language and culture,’ says Kulyuru. ‘I paint my mother’s story; I pass down the stories about women dancing around the fire, where my mother was born.’ This is particularly evident in the way Kulyuru utilises colour with energetic vigour to look at landscape with affection. Her paintings are a celebration of the vitality of the Lands and the important stories attached to place. This is Kulyuru’s first time as a finalist in the Wynne Prize.",False,data/images/2024_Muna Kulyuru_Ngayuku ngura _ my Country.jpg,2024_Muna Kulyuru_Ngayuku ngura _ my Country,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30704/
2024,Janet Koongotema,Moun.aw – Archer River story place,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"‘Moun.aw is one of the most beautiful places on my Country,’ Janet Koongotema recalls. ‘The sand is really white, and the water is really clear and fresh. You can see all the fishes like barramundi, catfish and red snappers swimming around.’ Koongotema is a senior artist working with Wik & Kugu Arts and a two-time Wynne finalist. She has painted a sacred aak puulwuy (story place) called Moun.aw, located along the Archer River, a place of high cultural significance to the Winchanam clan and only accessible to traditional owners. ‘Moun.aw is really good, but you have to be careful when the tide comes in … not just because of Pikkuw (the crocodile), but because of the fairies that live there. They protect this place,’ says Koongotema. In this work, Koongotema has translated her weaving practice into paint on canvas to capture the shimmering colours of Country as it transforms with the light of day. She also gives literal form to Waangk Aw, the dilly bag story place near Moun.aw, that she draws inspiration from.",False,data/images/2024_Janet Koongotema_Moun_aw _ Archer River story place.jpg,2024_Janet Koongotema_Moun_aw _ Archer River story place,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30703/
2024,Timo Hogan,Lake Baker,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This is Lake Baker, a vast salt lake in Western Australia. Timo Hogan, a first-time Wynne finalist, holds cultural authority for this place – a right inherited through his father. Lake Baker is a site of both power and danger. Hogan explains in Pitjantjatjara that this notion is called mill-mill-pa, a term for the ‘dangerously sacred’. The tjukurpa of Wati kutjara (two men) is connected to Lake Baker. The two men are represented by Hogan as two small grass tussocks, whose tracks are visible upon the lake’s surface. Nearby, Wanampi, the powerful water serpent, carves out the lake’s boundary. Using a palette knife and a limited colour range of soft creams and yellows, Hogan has recorded Lake Baker from memory to show both the seen and unseen forces of the site. The success of Hogan’s practice is in his ability to emotively document a physical landscape shaped by power and presence. He presents Lake Baker as a sentient being brimming with meaning, song and dance, for those who have the means to see it.",False,data/images/2024_Timo Hogan_Lake Baker.jpg,2024_Timo Hogan_Lake Baker,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30702/
2024,Simon Hogan,Lingka,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"Simon Hogan has painted Lingka, a site near his birthplace in the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia. For Hogan, there is no place of greater importance: when painting and retelling the stories of Lingka, Hogan’s connection to the earth is galvanised and becomes inseparable from place. While constructing this work, Hogan drew on his memories of visiting Lingka as a young man. He presents evidence of a landscape touched by ancestral beings who once had power and influence on a tectonic scale. His circular forms indicate a changing landscape after severe flooding, when the owl man, Wati wirutja was drowned, while his brother, the wedge-tailed eagle man, Wati walawuru, hunted for game nearby. Hogan’s precise dotting in bright colours to mimic the metamorphic powers that shaped this landscape have been laid down with deep intention. Hogan is a senior artist working from Spinifex Arts Project in Tjuntjuntjara.

2024,Sophia Whitney Hewson,Untitled (the fear of committing a sin),bronze,"Untitled (the fear of committing a sin) is inspired by an object that Sophia Whitney Hewson, a first-time Wynne finalist, encountered at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens: an ancient Grecian death mask cast from the face of a five-year-old child some 2000 years ago. Hewson was struck by its grim echo in the online images documenting infant deaths in present-day conflicts. The artist was compelled to model her own clay version of the death mask, which she then cast in bronze. The chain attached to the bottom of the sculpture has several sombre associations, including the pull of gravity and tools for weight and measurement. With this sculpture, Hewson asks: ‘Why do we measure the death of one child as less than another?’",False,data/images/2024_Sophia Whitney Hewson_Untitled _the fear of committing a sin_.jpg,2024_Sophia Whitney Hewson_Untitled _the fear of committing a sin_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30700/
2024,"Claire Healy, Sean Cordeiro",Grey nomadic visions,synthetic polymer gouache and LED lights on two truck doors,"Grey nomadic visions directs us to an everyday view from a driver’s seat: the rear doors of trucks that move commodities across Australia. Winners of the 2022 Sulman Prize, Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro enliven the truck doors with gold paint, LED lights, a ‘Blackberry’ pattern attributed to 19th-century English designer William Morris, and a camel. Synonymous with nomadic cultures in the northern hemisphere, the camel – like the blackberry – is an invasive species in Australia, introduced for the transport of goods between desert outposts. Beyond these references, the artists also nod to Dekotora (Japanese decorated trucks); Yokohama-e woodblock prints, depicting Western traders in 19th-century Yokohama; and Razorback , the 1980s Australian desert-horror film. Inspired by a previous collaboration with Martu artists from the Pilbara region of Western Australia involving weaving and reclaimed car parts, Healy’s and Cordeiro’s darkly humorous work upends romantic notions of Australia’s sunburnt landscapes. Bringing the tangled connections between colonisation, consumption, leisure and environmental damage into our field of vision, its flashing red lights offer both decorative relief and instructive warning.",False,data/images/2024_Claire Healy_ Sean Cordeiro_Grey nomadic visions.jpg,2024_Claire Healy_ Sean Cordeiro_Grey nomadic visions,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30691/
2024,Julia Gutman,Olive,found textiles and wire,"Cutting, layering and sewing disparate pieces of second-hand clothing together, Julia Gutman reconstitutes people and experiences with woven matter. This textile and wire sculpture depicts a close friend cradling a whippet called Olive, on a day of intense personal grief. The frayed edges, loose stitches and wonky seams convey something of the uneven emotional textures Gutman recalls of that day. Loaded into Gutman’s textile works are the unknown personal histories embedded in old fabric. She explains the significance of her materials: ‘Clothes drape our bodies and move with us through life, they take on our smell and the contours of our form, so it makes sense that they feel like the closest thing we have to someone who wore them. I think garments often become physical artefacts of the past: stand-ins for those we have lost, or relics of who we once were.’ This is Gutman’s first time as a finalist in the Wynne Prize.

2024,Juan Ford,At the peak,oil on linen,"This painting depicts a temporary sculpture erected by Juan Ford on Victoria’s highest mountain, Warkwoolowler/Mount Bogong. Collecting litter during a nine-hour hike up the remote mountain, Ford assembled it into a sculpture at the summit, incorporating branches and foliage as well. The result was a rickety cairn, briefly extending the height of the peak. Ford, who is a five-time Wynne finalist, explains that ‘such an absurd action is a recognition that for all our heedless actions and pollution (now found at the remotest corners of the Earth), we are insignificant before vast natural processes.’ Painted over a lengthy period from site drawings and photographs, the final work reveals no mountain vistas. We see only Ford’s assemblage against a wide blue sky – a meagre monument to contemporary human presence in a landscape he calls ‘huge and unknowable’.",False,data/images/2024_Juan Ford_At the peak.jpg,2024_Juan Ford_At the peak,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30698/
2024,Zaachariaha Fielding,Paralpi,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This work depicts the sounds of Paralpi, a special place found just outside of Mimili on the eastern part of the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia. ‘Paralpi is a place where people come to embrace and celebrate children,’ says Fielding. ‘They are taught by the Elders how to move and mimic their clan emblem, and, for Mimili, this has always been the maku (witchetty grub).’ Paralpi is an extension of Fielding’s previous Inma series (2019–23), which includes the titular work that won him the 2023 Wynne Prize. Fielding’s scratchy application of Pitjantjatjara text as a stylistic element used to outline and define Country also captures reverberations of bodies performing the act of inma (ceremonial song and dance). ‘When this inma is sung, the sounds of the soprano, alto, tenors and baritone are thick, hitting the heart and then returning to the ngura (country),’ Fielding describes. According to Fielding, who is also a finalist in the 2024 Sulman Prize, this is a cyclical process unique to Aṉangu culture, which celebrates one’s interconnectedness with the land.",False,data/images/2024_Zaachariaha Fielding_Paralpi.jpg,2024_Zaachariaha Fielding_Paralpi,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30697/
2024,Robert Fielding,Nganampa Manta,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This is an expanse of country found on the edge of Mimili within the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia. Robert Fielding, a first-time Wynne and Archibald Prize finalist, has returned to this place many times over the past 30 years. ‘When I first moved to Mimili, I was just learning my culture’s ways,’ says Fielding. ‘This was a place from which I could watch, observe, learn, and sit in silence, listening to country, listening to inma (ceremonial song and dance), watching from afar.’ Fielding’s painting layers photograph and memory to veil what should be kept secret from an uninitiated audience. His bold colours and overpainting give the landscape a sense of movement, heavily implying that this place is alive. This is a sentience formed from the beating heart of community, which the artist likens to the earth’s rhythm. ‘You can see far from up here, seeing all the people that have come before us, all the people yet to come,’ Fielding adds. ‘Iriti kuwari ngula – past, present and future – all connected in this earth.’",False,data/images/2024_Robert Fielding_Nganampa Manta.jpg,2024_Robert Fielding_Nganampa Manta,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30696/
2024,Nic Fern,The three graces,underglaze and glaze on stoneware,"Using a small brush and diluted underglaze, Nic Fern sketches verdant garden scenes onto her hand-built forms. Roaming these lush landscapes are naked figures reminiscent of Grecian athletes, or the countless depictions of the nude that appear throughout art history. Informed by Western art antecedents, Fern’s references include Michelangelo’s Renaissance figure sculptures, Paul Gauguin’s modernist renditions of Tahitian women and Pablo Picasso’s cubist distortions of the body. In this grouping, however, one of the vessels has been left unillustrated, with Fern wanting its hues and form to suggest a more natural portrayal of flesh. The first-time Wynne finalist describes her work as exploring the continuity between historical interpretations of the figure and ‘contemporary ideals of beauty and normative gender’.",False,data/images/2024_Nic Fern_The three graces.jpg,2024_Nic Fern_The three graces,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30695/
2024,Craig Elliott,Schrödinger the cat,epoxy resin and lacquer,"Cast in resin from a plasticine maquette, Craig Elliott’s anthropomorphic form is frozen in the realisation of its own existential emptiness. Its hollow core takes inspiration from the story of Prometheus, the Titan in Greek myth who suffered the torment of having his liver torn out by an eagle every day for eternity. Elliott injects amusing pathos into this tragic figure by giving the sculpture cartoon characteristics – a pop-inspired trope that employs commercial imagery to convey themes of deeper significance. Having worked as a model-maker, character designer and animator, the first-time Wynne finalist teams comic-like familiarity with philosophical intent in this sculpture. The work’s title, Elliott explains, ‘is an absurdist play on the quantum theory of Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, wherein a hypothetical cat may be considered both alive and dead simultaneously because its fate is linked to an event that may or may not have occurred’.",False,data/images/2024_Craig Elliott_Schrödinger the cat.jpg,2024_Craig Elliott_Schrödinger the cat,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30694/
2024,George Cooley,Opal Country,synthetic polymer paint on board,"‘The area I’ve painted is part of the Stuart Ranges, just north of Coober Pedy,’ says George Cooley. ‘This is a place I have visited many times since my early teens. It’s a place where I go camping, hunting and gathering bush tucker, and where opals are found.’ Cooley has worked from memory to paint this location, documenting the landscape and its spectacular mesas, ridges and sloping escarpments. He uses an aerial viewpoint to increase the sense of vastness and builds up rich layers of paint with a palette knife to celebrate the extraordinary beauty of desert colour, form and light. The work also draws from his many years of prospecting for opals on the land. Cooley began his career as a visual artist in 2021, working through the newly established Umoona Community Art Centre in Coober Pedy.

2024,Matthew Clarke,The Great South Coast wind power,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"Matthew Clarke’s paintings celebrate the marvels of his everyday environment on Gunditjmara Country in south-western Victoria, in and near the coastal town of Warrnambool. The region’s wind farms are a particular subject of fascination for Clarke. In this painting, he uses vibrant colour and pattern to describe their immense rhythmic presence amid vast green fields. The two-time Wynne finalist explains: ‘This is a painting about land use and the environment. My paintings of wind farms have often been described as sunflowers popping out of the landscape, but they are wind farms popping out of the landscape. I hope it has the softest political overtones. South-west Victoria is traditionally a conservative place and there is opposition to wind farms.’",False,data/images/2024_Matthew Clarke_The Great South Coast wind power.jpg,2024_Matthew Clarke_The Great South Coast wind power,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30690/
2024,Armando Chant,Untitled,"linen thread, pigment and binder on linen","Unfixed from time and place, with vaporous, mirage-like softness, Armando Chant’s landscapes are ‘instigators for an imaginative engagement,’ he says. They emerge from a gradual process of abstraction that starts with found negatives of early-20th-century landscape photographs. Overlaying multiple negatives, Chant prints a composite image at a large scale and draws onto its surface. He then collaborates with artisans in India to embroider the composition onto linen. When the work returns from the artisans, Chant explains, ‘it is abstracted, changed; it is never what I expect’. The final step is to paint pigmented washes over the fabric, further diffusing the spectral image. A first-time Wynne finalist, Chant acknowledges his collaborators, Mohammed Waseem, Mohammed Irfan, Mohammed Imran, Mohammed Fahim and Mohammed Tasleem, for the embroidery on this work.",False,data/images/2024_Armando Chant_Untitled.jpg,2024_Armando Chant_Untitled,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30692/
2024,Polly Borland,BOD (Buttercup),automotive paint on cast aluminium,"Polly Borland’s bulging and asymmetrical figures bear no resemblance to the svelte silhouettes of classical sculpture. BOD (buttercup) relates closely to the first-time Wynne finalist’s Morph photographic series, in which she encases a human subject in a stocking and stuffs lumpy padding inside. For this sculpture, a padded figure was 3D-scanned to create a digital model, from which a mould was made. Both clownish and monstrous, Borland’s bloated beings prod our deepest fears about physical imperfection. They can also be interpreted as visualising psychological anxieties, such as our drive to present a defined and cohesive self to the world. Abstracting bodies and bringing them to an ambiguous state lends them mythical qualities, Borland believes, with the potential – like a chrysalis – to metamorphose into something else.",False,data/images/2024_Polly Borland_BOD _Buttercup_.jpg,2024_Polly Borland_BOD _Buttercup_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30689/

He has painted Melville Island, the largest of a group known as the Tiwi Islands, off the coast of the Northern Territory. Specifically, Black has documented the parts of his father’s and mother’s Country that he deeply loves. He has included Jurrupi/Jessie River, which he has connections to through his father, and Yapalika/Maxwell Creek, through his mother. Black’s unique composition and mark-making is suggestive of an artist painting with purpose. His scratchy, geometric linework reveals the places where the artist likes to fish, hunt and gather. ‘I like going into the mangrove to collect jukwarringa (mud mussels), kurumpuka (mud crabs), piranga (long bum) and yuwurli (mangrove worms),’ he explains. Black is an early career artist working through Munupi Arts.

2024,Natasha Bieniek,Digitalis,oil on wood,"Although tiny, Natasha Bieniek’s Digitalis conjures the extravagance of nature’s largesse – a scene of bobbing flowers, gleaming foliage and rolling clouds. It depicts the lush Burnley Gardens, a short walk from the artist’s inner-Melbourne studio. The gardens contain some of the oldest trees in the city and are a common subject for Bieniek, who won the Wynne Prize in 2015 and is also a finalist in the 2024 Archibald and Sulman Prizes. A proponent of the miniature painting tradition, Bieniek presents one of her smallest works to date. Informed by 16th-century French and English miniatures, it also has its origins in a more contemporary, scaled-down image. As Bieniek explains: ‘We are obsessed with recording and documenting our surroundings, and as a result, often experience our environment through screens. Digitalis was painted directly from an iPhone image. The title is the scientific name for the flowering plant foxglove, which features in my painting, but it also points to my interest in digital culture.’",False,data/images/2024_Natasha Bieniek_Digitalis.jpg,2024_Natasha Bieniek_Digitalis,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2024/30687/

He challenges the stereotypes associated with Aboriginality within big cities in his efforts to decolonise and Indigenise the landscape and public space. Bain created this work over several months. He builds his installations intuitively, letting the forms take on shape and personality as they come to life.

Although the lives of those inside have surely changed over this period, she observes, the home itself represents a compelling sense of continuity. A long-time resident of Mullumbimby in northern NSW , Sweaney experienced the 2022 floods that submerged parts of the town and displaced its residents. This painting conveys a soothing measure of domestic order and security, yet Sweaney notes that the shadow of change is nevertheless present: ‘within this fleeting moment of peace and stillness there is that edge suggesting it is merely an illusion – a stage set to an ongoing story’.",False,data/images/2023_Robyn Sweaney_Mullum magic.jpg,2023_Robyn Sweaney_Mullum magic,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30602/

I have been reluctant to listen, distracted by the task of finding myself in this place. I have been reluctant to hear the Voice even while all that time the Voice was speaking, singing, waiting for me to hear it. The Voice doesn’t shout.

The figures are superimposed on an image of Eugene von Guérard’s 1863 Weatherboard Falls . Today known as Wentworth Falls, in the Blue Mountains, NSW , the site is in an area Ross called home for over 30 years. In her digitally manipulated and hand-painted remake of von Guérard’s work, she makes the waterfall a fluoro yellow – a colour that evokes contemporary ‘high-vis’ and creates an alien appearance in the landscape. The scent of colonisation is still strong, Ross suggests: ‘Possession is a perfume of greed.’ A regular in recent Archibald and Sulman exhibitions, Ross won the Sulman Prize in 2019.

It also recalls the 17th-century Dutch tradition of vanitas still-life painting, which used symbolic objects to remind the viewer of their mortality. The work took more than two years to realise. For its creation, Pratt developed software, in collaboration with Australian academic Dr Nico Pietroni, which calculates the trajectory of light as it bends through curved reflective surfaces and transparent media. Pratt, a three-time Wynne finalist, explains: ‘The ghost-like appearance of the reflection results from the interplay between the mirror, sculpture and the eye of the viewer … I’m always looking to create something that pushes the boundaries of what is possible and extends the canon of art; that expresses the interconnectedness between the digital and the physical worlds and imbues the audience with a sense of wonder.’",False,data/images/2023_Louis Pratt_A very Dutch ghost.jpg,2023_Louis Pratt_A very Dutch ghost,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30597/

While only including a small pictorial representation of landscape, Powditch describes a vast historical one, listing the Wynne winners since 1897 in a format resembling a sports honour board. A notable detail is the sameness reflected in the winners’ names for much of the prize’s history, reminding us how the demographic ‘landscape’ of Australian art has recently evolved. ‘By using the honour board concept, I hope that the work is accessible to everyone – evoking a sense of community and place, and maybe inspiring people to look into the history and evolution of landscape painting in Australia,’ says Powditch, who is also a finalist in this year’s Archibald Prize.",False,data/images/2023_James Powditch_The Wynne Club Championship.jpg,2023_James Powditch_The Wynne Club Championship,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30596/

2023,John Olsen,The lake recedes,oil and acrylic on linen,"The lake recedes is the last major work John Olsen made before his death on 11 April 2023. The painting marks a final return to a subject that never stopped enchanting him. Olsen first visited Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre, located on Arabana Country in South Australia, in 1974. That year he encountered the desert basin in full flood, ‘boiling with animal, bird and fish life’ and shimmering in a ‘light beyond our grasping’. In this painting, Olsen’s spidery linework and fluid brushstrokes release their energy into a yawning pink firmament, capturing the lake’s inevitable process of depletion. The artist’s son Tim Olsen says, ‘The work was inspired by photographs and memories of the pervading pink salt which appears in Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre as the water dissipates. It was always a mystery to John how the centre of Australia becomes a living sea – suddenly, a desert becomes a place full of fish and birdlife. Then, as the lake evaporates, the abundance turns into desolation. Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre is a freak of nature, a metaphor for life and death. In all of Australia, it was his spiritual place.’ This is John Olsen’s 11th work in the Wynne Prize, which he won in 1969 and 1985. He also won the Sulman Prize in 1989, and the Archibald Prize in 2005 – the oldest artist to do so, at age 77.",False,data/images/2023_John Olsen_The lake recedes.jpg,2023_John Olsen_The lake recedes,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30594/

This is her mother’s Country. Nungarrayi’s circular roundel indicates the main rock hole found in this area, while the surrounding shapes indicate the trees, shrubs, grasses, maku (witchetty grubs) and bush medicine plants. Scratched, linear marks, which border both flora and fauna, symbolise the shifting tali (sandhills) that surround the area. Nungarrayi is a senior artist working from Papunya Tjupi Arts.

2023,Jonny Niesche,Bexhill Quarry (after N.O.),"dyed voile, aluminium, mirror-polished brass","Jonny Niesche sees colour as an all-encompassing element of our environment. He says, ‘It is on the surface of everything we see, everything around us; it physiologically affects our experience of the world.’ The cool hues in this work refer to the water inside the old Bexhill Quarry, a popular swimming spot on Bundjalung Country in northern NSW . Created by dyeing transparent fabric, which is then layered and stretched over the picture frame, Niesche’s near intangible field of pigment summons the sensation of plunging into a deep, clear pool. Niesche is interested in a shade of water that represents something ‘almost unreachable and perfect’ and is used to sell holiday experiences the world over. This drew him to the quarry, where a turquoise tint is maintained by a mix of natural minerals leaching from the former mine site. In this depiction of the site, Niesche’s paradisal colours meet the consequences of environmental extraction. A first-time Wynne finalist, Niesche was previously a finalist in the Sulman Prize.",False,data/images/2023_Jonny Niesche_Bexhill Quarry _after N_O__.jpg,2023_Jonny Niesche_Bexhill Quarry _after N_O__,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30592/
2023,Mantua Nangala,Untitled,acrylic on linen,"‘Yiwarra tjuțapiinta ngaangka tali tjuța nyinanyingka Marrapinti,’ says Mantua Nangala, a two-time Wynne Prize finalist. She explains that the shimmering lines in her work are the sandhills at the site of Marrapinti, west of the Pollock Hills in Western Australia. ‘It is a sacred site for women,’ Nangala says. ‘We do lore here.’ As a leading member of Papunya Tula Artists, Nangala consistently paints Marrapinti, using up to five colours and creamy whites to create the illusion of movement on the canvas and, thereby, the sentience of Country. In the tjukurrpa, women camped at this rock hole, before passing east through Wala Wala, Kiwirrkurra and Ngaminya. While at the site the women made nose bones, which are worn through a hole made in a person’s nose web. These objects are called marrapinti, from which this site takes its name, and are still used by older Pintupi people during ceremonial occasions.",False,data/images/2023_Mantua Nangala_Untitled.jpg,2023_Mantua Nangala_Untitled,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30591/
2023,Dhambit Munuŋgurr,Yolŋu voice,acrylic on bark,"This work shows Gunyuŋarra/Ski Beach, the home of Dhambit Munuŋgurr, in Melville Bay, North-east Arnhem Land. The community is part of the Gumatj homelands and was established by Munuŋgurr’s maternal grandfather, Muŋgurrawuy Yunupiŋu, when he led a return to Country in the 1970s, away from missionary influence and control. Gunyuŋarra has a rich history of political action; the community was run by land rights campaigner G Yunupiŋu, the artist’s uncle, until his recent death. Munuŋgurr, a three-time Wynne Prize finalist, made this work in June 2022, following the federal election. Here, Munuŋgurr has depicted herself as a candidate on a campaign poster, which has been nailed to a stringybark tree. The artist says, ‘I painted the tide, which is bringing more and more Indigenous people into Parliament, as shown by the canoe full of Yolŋu heading to shore. They are landing at Gunyuŋarra, which is the home of my family’s fight for a Yolŋu voice to be heard.’ Munuŋgurr’s inclusion of a kangaroo and emu at the bottom of the work – the Australian coat of arms – shows that the people are heading to Parliament.",False,data/images/2023_Dhambit Munuŋgurr_Yolŋu voice.jpg,2023_Dhambit Munuŋgurr_Yolŋu voice,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30590/
2023,Danie Mellor,Shadow land (water talking story place),acrylic on linen with gesso and iridescent wash,"Depicted here is Wiinggina/Lake Eacham, a volcanic crater lake and a site of the serpent Yamani in the Atherton Tablelands. This is Ngadjon-jii, Danie Mellor’s Country, and the work was created following fieldtrips and visits to the tablelands, made over several years. It is a place that is ‘profoundly beautiful’, says Mellor. ‘The gentle, mineral-coloured azure waters contrast with verdant greens and rich, primordial forms and vegetation of towering fig trees and lush rainforest.’ Such a landscape is evident in Shadow land (water talking story place) ; however, Mellor’s purposeful sepia toning of the work has been used to locate this scene in a period of history documented by early photographic techniques. His inclusion of bama (people), who return our gaze while drifting in a canoe near the lake’s shoreline, reflects on the complex histories of colonised landscapes from Mellor’s Country, and the ethnographic ‘othering’ of Indigenous peoples. This is the second consecutive year that Mellor has been selected as a Wynne finalist.

2023,Guido (Guy) Maestri,Wombarra,oil on linen,"During the COVID lockdowns, Guido Maestri’s painting practice took an unusual turn. Unable to travel and paint en plein air , Maestri started making landscape dioramas to work from instead. This idea was inspired by the miniature world he shares with his five-year-old son, August. ‘Everything August plays with is a tiny version of something life-sized – a vehicle, a rainbow, a mountain. This is how we gain our initial understanding of the world, on a mini and tangible scale,’ Maestri says. Although Wombarra is based on an area of coastal rainforest north of Wollongong, on Dharawal Country, Maestri delights in the elements of strangeness that emerge in his painted translations of toy-sized models. ‘When painting from these dioramic gardens there is still a kind of naturalistic space or depth to work from. There is also an artificiality that gives the painting an otherworldly feel. ‘The building of a landscape fascinates me. You are the creator or gardener. It’s not fixed – you can manipulate the ‘stage’ before you start, or as you go. The painting becomes an idea or a memory, twice removed. And after a while, you disregard the reference, and the painting develops its own life and place,’ says Maestri, a nine-time Wynne finalist, who won the 2009 Archibald Prize.",False,data/images/2023_Guido _Guy_ Maestri_Wombarra.jpg,2023_Guido _Guy_ Maestri_Wombarra,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30512/
2023,Christopher McVinish,Christmas in Katoomba,oil on canvas,"Christopher McVinish, a two-time Wynne finalist, describes his paintings as ‘architectural landscapes’, a theme he has pursued as an artist since age 15. His work in this year’s Wynne documents a slice of Katoomba’s main street, in the Blue Mountains where the artist lives. Peeling paint and rumpled tin awnings contrast with a carefully arranged Christmas display in the windows. A dark sky and an empty street lend a beguilingly lonely air – what McVinish calls ‘a touch of film noir’. Made over four months from sketches and photos taken in the early-morning light, this painting conveys the artist’s observation of the ‘magic in the everyday’.",False,data/images/2023_Christopher McVinish_Christmas in Katoomba.jpg,2023_Christopher McVinish_Christmas in Katoomba,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30510/
2023,Noel McKenna,South Coast,"watercolour, ink on paper","Noel McKenna paints scenes from his everyday environment, focusing on overlooked details to reveal poetic and poignant aspects of the world around him. South Coast portrays a spare coastline that has been mostly cleared and permanently altered. Two birds perch on a fence in the foreground, indifferent to the separation between ocean and park. In this unpeopled setting, the Norfolk Island pines and bald headland in the distance have near anthropomorphic qualities. McKenna explains that this work ‘is of no place in particular’ but made from memories of trips to places south of Sydney, such as Thirroul, Wollongong and Port Kembla: ‘I used to often get the train down from Central. One gets glimpses of the coastline from the train, so this image is a sort of fusion of views I have noticed.’ This is McKenna’s 26th time as a Wynne Prize finalist. He has won the Trustees’ Watercolour Prize five times, of which two paintings were South Coast landscapes.",False,data/images/2023_Noel McKenna_South Coast.jpg,2023_Noel McKenna_South Coast,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30511/
2023,Dane Lovett,Garden in a parking lot,oil and acrylic on canvas,"Garden in a parking lot was inspired by a recently established patch of green in inner Melbourne, near Dane Lovett’s home. It was made after visiting a friend’s new garden, wedged between a carpark and a warehouse, says the artist, a first-time Wynne finalist. ‘The area was once marshland, then farmland and now an inner-city suburb. The garden itself has also been designed to change throughout the seasons. I chose to paint a small section from above in an all-encompassing scale, which is often how I view the environment on my walk to and from my studio. It can look both familiar and terrifying.’ The painting belongs to a series of works in which Lovett extracts details from nature, often from the ground, then renders them at an immense size. Using tonal washes of near monochromatic colour, he confuses distinctions between positive and negative space, drawing us into a plant world that is ambiguous, almost alien.",False,data/images/2023_Dane Lovett_Garden in a parking lot.jpg,2023_Dane Lovett_Garden in a parking lot,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30588/
2023,Sam Leach,Machine-assisted river,oil on linen,"Machine-assisted river has the hallmarks of a 17th-century Dutch landscape painting – a winding river and a twilight sky contrast with leafy foreground shadows. But this idyll is disquieting; foliage disintegrates into puffs of cloud and the river flows upwards. Sam Leach’s starting point for this work was a machine-learning algorithm known as a generative adversarial network. Leach feeds the algorithm diverse scenic imagery, from Australian bushland to historical paintings, which generates new composite landscapes, based on what was input. Leach works with the digital flaws and inconsistencies of the outcome to play with how we imaginatively construct and romanticise nature. He explains, ‘I am interested in how historical representations of landscape influence our understanding of the world around us and how we often reshape the world to resemble those idealised images.’ Leach won both the Wynne and Archibald Prizes in 2010; this is his third time in the Wynne. He is also the subject of a portrait by Keith Burt in this year’s Archibald.",False,data/images/2023_Sam Leach_Machine-assisted river.jpg,2023_Sam Leach_Machine-assisted river,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30587/
2023,Janet Koongotema,Mo’iam – Archer River,acrylic on linen,"Janet Koongotema was born on Wik-Mungkan Country in Aurukun, on Cape York Peninsula. When she was a young child, her father, Edward, worked as a ringer on southern Wik lands mustering cattle. On occasion, he would take Koongotema and her sister Dawn to visit Mo’iam, which is depicted here. She recalls, ‘We would travel a long way up the main Archer River and turn off up a long narrow creek … when we arrived, we could see many different colours in the land, even the colour of gold.’ Mo’iam is a sacred aak puulwuy (story place) for Wik people of the Winchanam clan, as well as a very important location for the artist’s family. Due to its significance, Koongotema regularly paints Mo’iam, along with her family’s other aak puulwuy. It is integral to Koongotema that she helps to keep this location healthy, so that the knowledge of Country can be passed on to her grandchildren. She says, ‘I want to teach people about our culture and to share the wonderful stories we have been taught, which [explain] how to respect the land.’ This is Koongotema’s first time as a Wynne finalist.",False,data/images/2023_Janet Koongotema_Mo_iam _ Archer River.jpg,2023_Janet Koongotema_Mo_iam _ Archer River,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30586/

That’s a good story.’ Since 2005 Kemarre has been a driving force behind the revival of a sculptural practice that first emerged in the Aboriginal homelands of Utopia, Northern Territory, in the 1980s. He works alongside his wife, Josie Kunoth Petyarre, and the pair regularly collaborate on works that celebrate the role of AFL in Indigenous communities. For Kemarre, matches have a family focus and are an opportunity to engage with community.

2023,Gregory Hodge,Pattern in a landscape,acrylic on linen,"Gregory Hodge’s landscapes are an amalgam of the different places he spends time in. In this work, he has merged impressions of forests around Paris, France, with those of coastal bush on the NSW South Coast. Referencing his photographs, collages and drawings, Hodge built the image using a controlled language of painterly marks that creates a pattern-like effect. Hints of spatial depth are collapsed by the flatness of the intricate surface, something that reflects his interest in translating the physical properties of textile into painting. ‘I have been looking specifically at 17th- and 18th-century tapestries that depict northern European landscapes,’ says Hodge, a two-time Sulman finalist and first-time finalist in the Wynne. ‘By layering dragged painted marks, I try to emulate a woven surface, giving the illusion that the image is embedded within texture. These all-over horizontal and vertical striations of paint become reminiscent of the texture of a tapestry.’",False,data/images/2023_Gregory Hodge_Pattern in a landscape.jpg,2023_Gregory Hodge_Pattern in a landscape,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30584/

When the trees are flowering, my people head to the beach. It is an invitation to the sea.’ Hobson has painted Coen, a small township in the eastern Cape York region. In her work, she has captured an important occasion for community when the wattle blooms. ‘I love this time; everything is intimate and in full colour. The Country is buzzing,’ says the artist. For Hobson, this work is an ode to and a celebration of nature. Hobson is a passionate storyteller whose artistic career spans painting, ceramics and photography, with a particular focus on projects that include and celebrate her community and culture. She says, ‘My brushstrokes are guided by my Ancestors … I want to share the bright light of the Cape, which is embedded in the colours of Country and our traditional stories.’",False,data/images/2023_Naomi Hobson_Golden wattle among eucalyptus.jpg,2023_Naomi Hobson_Golden wattle among eucalyptus,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30583/

This is the view from the bedroom window, looking towards the lights of Coorparoo Square. I had never seen the view this obstructed by rain before; it completely collapsed a sense of distance between us and the rest of the city,’ says Hine, a first-time finalist in the Wynne Prize. A study of the light and atmospherics of urban darkness, From the window at Coorparoo during floods recalls the muted work of Australian tonalists such as Clarice Beckett, who explored the spatial effects of wet and misty environments. Hine says, ‘Capturing a sense of the colour, light, altered depth and the heavy, concentrated rain bouncing off rooves was a technical challenge I wanted to see if I could achieve without being too literal.’",False,data/images/2023_Miranda Hine_From the window at Coorparoo during floods.jpg,2023_Miranda Hine_From the window at Coorparoo during floods,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30582/

Heffernan was previously selected as a finalist in the Wynne Prize in 2021, also for a painting of kapi tjukula (water-filled rock holes). In this 2023 work, she has depicted the rock holes that can be found across the vast APY Lands, where water collects after heavy rains.

2023,Clara Hali,Talus torso,bronze,"Talus torso is at once an assemblage of boulder-like forms and a figure rising out of chaos. It is inspired by the sandstone that crumbles off escarpments in the Blue Mountains where Clara Hali lives, accumulating in the valleys below to form what is called a talus. Hali finds a rich vein of metaphor in ancient rock that resisted gravity for millennia and then suddenly yielded to it. Strength and fragility are qualities she responds to in her work as a sculptor, but she also sees them as fundamental to the human condition. ‘Part of the reason that I am doing the work that I do is to communicate my experience as a common experience: a shared quest for finding balance and stability within our lives,’ says Hali, second-time finalist in the Wynne.",False,data/images/2023_Clara Hali_Talus torso.jpg,2023_Clara Hali_Talus torso,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30580/

In what Griffin terms ‘an intergenerational conduit’, she has included Halley’s comet, which can be seen travelling between sky and Country, moving through vapour-thin layers of paint, and time and space. Griffin has titled her work as an ode to Halley’s comet but also to her family. It is part of a body of work by Griffin that explores the intersection of Aboriginal and Western stories, which transcend multiple cultures and belief systems – ‘as above, so below’.",False,data/images/2023_Simone Griffin_Pilgrim.jpg,2023_Simone Griffin_Pilgrim,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30579/

This is an old story that has come from Country and is not to be interfered with but maintained. In her words, ‘tjunkukatingu mantangka tjunu pampuntja wiyangku wantima.’ Goodwin sees her artwork being a true reflection of this ancient knowledge. There are three main tjukurla (rock holes) at Antaṟa, where women will perform inma (dance and song). After they have shared the maku tjukurpa, maku will be collected for food. Goodwin is a strong leader for young Aṉangu and encourages the next generation to travel to Antaṟa, to see that the maku tjukurpa is alive at this place.

Fielding says, ‘This is a memory that I was able to document which happened in Paralpi. It’s a place that’s like the Sydney Opera House for the APY Lands! It’s where people come to embrace and celebrate children, teaching them how to move and mimic their clan emblem, and, for Mimili, this has always been the maku (witchetty grub).’ Fielding presents Mimili through a childhood lens, recalling observations of inma (song and dance) and movement. Fielding says, ‘The atmosphere of this work is full of sound, movement and teaching. All of the communities [are] coming together, shar[ing] their storylines. However, this platform is only for children.

In her recent work, her attention has shifted from the vastness of land, water and sky to the subtleties of nature’s small and wonderful details. Drysdale was drawn to interpret Wolfe Creek Crater, or Kandimalal to the Jaru people, for its ecosystem, which has evolved over 120,000 years since the moment of meteorite impact. Containing seasonal water, the rocky crater is a habitat for precious wildlife, which Drysdale distils in her abstract sculptural forms. ‘Working collaboratively with my dear friend and thrower, Warrick Palmateer, I turned to my memories of Wolfe Creek,’ says the first-time Wynne finalist. ‘Within the crater are brown ringtail dragons, whose colours can range from orange to pale beige with yellow on the underbelly, and butterflies such as the Glasswing or Spotted Dusky Blue, with their fluttering, glistening wings. The elusive Major Mitchell cockatoos are residents of the crater and are a stunning sight in flight against a backdrop of red rocks and blue skies.

In this painting we encounter the splendour of her high-country garden in late spring, glimpsing the contrasting textures of the Monaro beyond a dense wall of blooms and fresh foliage. The garden is a recurring theme for Culliton, as she savours its seasonal changes and the rewards of her nurturing. She says: ‘After much appreciated moisture, the garden showed her appreciation by delivering the best flower display I have seen in my 15 years living at Bibbenluke.

2023,Hayley Panangka Coulthard,Rama-rama nukanha yia (My great-great-grandmother’s story),underglaze on terracotta,"Hayley Panangka Coulthard is among a group of Western Aranda artists known as the Hermannsburg Potters, who are influenced by the painting style of Albert Namatjira (1902–59). Namatjira was a pioneer of the Hermannsburg school of watercolourists at Ntaria/Hermannsburg. This terracotta pot with a figurative lid tells the story of Coulthard’s Pitjantjatjara rama-rama (great-great-grandmother) Florrie. The painted landscape on the pot depicts Mutitjulu, the remote Aboriginal community where Florrie was born. At 18, Florrie ran away from Mutitjulu, because she did not want to marry. Florrie walked a long way, settling in Ntaria, where she eventually married a Western Aranda man. For the lid, Coulthard has sculpted Florrie holding her coolamon, which she used to collect bush foods to eat on her journey. A two-time Wynne finalist, Coulthard says she did not initially make this work for exhibition, ‘but when I finished [it], I wanted to find a way to share Florrie’s story for all the Hermannsburg family, so I entered it in the Wynne Prize’.

2023,Byron Copland,A Brunswick West alley,oil on wood,"It was the intrigue of human activity in this narrow alley, at one remove from the more communal street, which captured Byron Copland’s attention – ‘its varying textures, shapes and colours – the unmistakable character of a well-worn place, and the stories you imagine it could tell’. Copland – a first-time Wynne finalist – observed countless people and unusual incidents from the rear balcony of his Melbourne home, but painted the lane empty to amplify a sense of its anonymous histories.

2023,Matthew Clarke,King of the ghost wallabies,acrylic on plywood,"‘My brushstrokes have been described as “fiery”, and it feels like these strokes flowed with passion into this wallaby sculpture,’ says Matthew Clarke. Clarke has been bewitched by wallabies since 2012, when one appeared outside his loungeroom window. He finds the animal’s fugitive habits mysterious and compelling – the wallaby appears and disappears like a mythical creature. Based in his hometown of Warrnambool on Gunditjmara Country, Clarke explains that his surroundings are a constant inspiration, ‘whether it is wallabies coming into my garden, water birds on the river, or windfarms popping out of the landscape – or things that are as simple as my letterbox’. Clarke’s self-portrait has also been selected for this year’s Sulman Prize.

2023,Betty Chimney,Ngayuku ngura (My Country),acrylic on linen,"Betty Chimney has fond memories of Indulkana, South Australia. Since learning to paint from other artists at Iwantja Arts, she has consistently documented her home, specifically the area of Iwantja creek. ‘Ngayulu walkatjunanyi kapi piti, kapi tjukula munu iwara tjuta,’ says Chimney, detailing that the creek includes a waterhole, a soakage, and tracks nearby. Evident from Chimney’s use of colour and the marks she makes, this is a changing landscape, with the artist reflecting how Country moves from rocky ridges to sandy creek beds. Chimney was previously a finalist in the Wynne Prize in 2021, and in 2022 she was a finalist with a collaborative work painted with her daughter Raylene Walatinna. Through the process of working together, Chimney continues the age-old tradition of older women passing on their important knowledge of tjukurpa and ngura (Country) to future leaders. In her words, Chimney explains, ‘… it’s my responsibility to make sure that the younger generation are holding on to these traditions.’",False,data/images/2023_Betty Chimney_Ngayuku ngura _My Country_.jpg,2023_Betty Chimney_Ngayuku ngura _My Country_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30571/

She grew up on Everard Park station, where her father mustered cattle, and spent her days out bush with her sisters. They would often walk out to Paralpi/Victory Well, the location depicted in this work. ‘Ngayuku canvas minymaku inma kanyini,’ says Campbell, detailing that her work holds women’s story and inma (song and dance). A lot of this story is secret, only to be known by initiated women; however, there are some storylines that can be celebrated by all. Campbell paints the kulpi tjuṯa (many caves), tjukurla tjuṯa (many rock holes) and karu tjuṯa (many riverbeds) that spread across Paralpi. As a senior cultural leader of Mimili, she recognises the importance of taking young people to Paralpi to camp and dance inma, to learn and keep tjukurpa kunpu (strong).

In her Wynne 2023 work, she has painted Papuun, with its four rock holes, one of which is very large. Butler remembers swimming there during ‘the hot times’ with her family. Papuun means ‘to fan smoke with your hands’ and references the tjukurrpa of this site. Here, a woman named Kutungu, who was travelling from the south-west, trapped a pack of dogs in one of the rock holes by enclosing the entrance with dirt. Kutungu lit a fire to smoke out the dogs, fanning it into the burrow with her hands. When they came out, the dogs were dizzy and sick, and Kutungu hunted and feasted on them, before she continued her journey westward. Butler has been painting since the 1990s and is known for her dynamic and colourful paintings of Country.

At a site in Boonah, south-west of Brisbane on Yuggera Ugarapul Country, he was attracted to the wide and sloping street that divides the view; the soft foliage against built structures and powerlines was also an appealing contrast. Painting on location, Burt deliberately used a big brush and a small board to execute the work swiftly and restrict being distracted by details. The title Boonah plain air is ‘a reference to the habit among my friends of Australianising the French term en plein air, abbreviating it to ‘plain air’ for practical purposes,’ he says.

Regarded by many as strong Indigenous leaders, these athletes were chosen by Bain because they are ‘not only brilliant in their chosen sports, but because they also stand true to their culture and beliefs in an exceptionally volatile and political space’. In a country where sport holds so much cultural currency, Bain sees these five athletes as agents of change. He believes their voices are full of complexity and have a role to play in breaking performance barriers in their chosen sporting codes, inspiring young Indigenous people to stand tall. ‘To be a successful Indigenous person – thriving in a system and society that has denied your existence – is innately political,’ says Bain. Thus, to the artist, politics and sport will always be intertwined.

2023,Giles Alexander,When the fire came my loss was total (Australian bushfires from space),acrylic on birch,"At first glance, this painting is a familiar image of our blue planet. But up close, a brown tint stains the cloud mass in the foreground. First-time Wynne finalist Giles Alexander has painted an immense drift of bushfire smoke, spreading ominously over the Australian continent, which was captured in a photo taken from NASA’s International Space Station. With this painting, Alexander shifts our habitual sense of scale and points to the smallness and fragility of our home in the cosmos. He explains: ‘My painting practice wonders about “us”; I am interested in the human species. My work seeks to ask how we find a sense of belonging in our landscape, in a city, in a country, in the world, indeed in the universe.’",False,data/images/2023_Giles Alexander_When the fire came my loss was total _Australian bushfires from space_.jpg,2023_Giles Alexander_When the fire came my loss was total _Australian bushfires from space_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2023/30566/
2025,Kara Wood,The girls,"cardboard, plaster, wood, tufted thread, pompoms, pipe-cleaner, tassels, synthetic polymer paint","Kara Wood’s sculptures resemble oversized vases, but their jaunty poses and lavish adornments make them seem more like exuberant women. ‘The work challenges the way women are often overlooked, seen as useful and functional – much like vessels or carpets – without recognition of their true brilliance,’ says Wood. ‘By flipping this narrative, The girls celebrates women’s power, resilience and capacity for joy, embracing their usefulness not as a limitation but as a superpower.’ The Newcastle-based artist and first-time Wynne finalist turned to soft sculpture from ceramics to embrace her love of textiles – and to transcend the size restrictions of her kiln. She first built the vessels in cardboard then coated them in plaster for strength. She made dressmaker-style patterns for their exteriors and tufted the textile elements piece by piece, adding wooden legs so the vessels could stand ‘as if caught mid-dance’. The process took over three months. Wood hopes that The girls will ‘evoke joy and freedom from expectation’. No longer passive objects, they stand firm: claiming space.",False,data/images/2025_Kara Wood_The girls.jpg,2025_Kara Wood_The girls,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30879/
2025,Terry Williams,Untitled,"fabric, foam, stuffing, wool, fibre-tipped pen","In the 1950s and 1960s, Terry Williams’ mother created textile art and made puppets for a shop in Melbourne. Around this time, at the age of ten, Williams began to make soft toys of his own. In this untitled self-portrait, Williams revels in the materiality of fabric and stuffing. His body is fleshy and flannel-clad; expressively askew and bursting at the seams. Williams takes an improvisational approach to his sculptures, drawing shapes directly onto fabric or cutting them out freehand. Panels are sewn together with wool to create pillow-like forms with visible hand-stitching. Once started, his sculptures come together rapidly: this one in the space of a week. A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Williams has worked at the Melbourne-based studio Arts Project Australia since 1989, and continues to practise there five days a week.

In the foreground, a pot of chrysanthemum and goji berry tea rests on a table at the tea house at White Rabbit Gallery in Chippendale, while in the background, a lush scene from Wendy Whiteley’s ‘Secret Garden’ in Quiberee, or Lavender Bay, is seen through a window. ‘This painting creates an imaginary place that is half remembered, half dream,’ Walsh says. ‘The window plays with the idea that painting itself is an imaginary window. A window that looks at the outside world through the inner world of the human mind.’ The artist’s unique painting methods have been developed through extensive research and experimentation. She applies handmade paint pigments onto sheets of copper to create alchemical works that transform over time. Walsh won the 2018 Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship at the age of 24.

A perentie lizard ancestor entered the ground at this site and travelled underground to the south. Perentie are some of the largest lizards in the world. Known for the unique patterning on their scales, they are significant for many First Nations people connected to Central Australia. Tjungurrayi is one of the youngest artists currently working through the Papunya Tula Artists studio in Kiwirrkurra, Western Australia.

2025,Angus Tjungurrayi,Untitled,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This painting depicts the swamp site of Marawa, situated slightly west of Wilkinkarra/Lake Mackay in Western Australia. In ancestral times, a large group of Tingari men travelled to Marawa from the west. After arriving at the site, they passed beneath the earth’s surface, continuing underground. It is also said that an ancestral snake sleeps in this swamp. Much of the information around the Tingari cycle, a series of events that occurred during the creation era, is restricted and reserved for those who have been initiated into ceremonial practices and customs. Angus Tjungurrayi is the son of painters Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri and Yalti Napangati from Papunya Tula Artists.

2025,Aubrey Tjangala,Untitled,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This work by first-time Wynne Prize finalist Aubrey Tjangala features body-paint designs associated with Malparingya, located slightly west of Walungurru/Kintore in the Northern Territory. In the distant past, two snakes seeking water travelled to this site from the east, only to find none there. Lightning strikes forced the snakes to leave, causing them to burrow deep into the ground. Their movements created a large claypan and soakages, which remain at the site today. Tjangala is the son of Ronnie Tjampitjinpa, a founding figure of the Western Desert art movement of the early 1970s, who went on to help establish the renowned cooperative Papunya Tula Artists. In this painting, Tjangala demonstrates the style that he has inherited from his father, using undulating linework and boldly contrasting black-and-white tones.",False,data/images/2025_Aubrey Tjangala_Untitled.jpg,2025_Aubrey Tjangala_Untitled,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30874/

Under a voluntary buyback scheme operated by the state government, some houses in this region have been purchased from their owners and fenced off for 12 months, allowing for the reuse or recycling of the buildings’ materials. A Murwillumbah local, Robyn Sweaney selected one such home as the subject of her painting. Parts of the town were particularly affected by flooding in 2017 and 2022, and she created this work in March 2025, just after the area was battered by Cyclone Alfred. ‘The North Coast is being hit more frequently by intense weather events, which has affected many living and working in the community,’ she says. ‘Lack of housing and housing affordability are problems Australia-wide, but it’s complex once houses are affected by flooding and storms, and people wish to remain in the area.’ A six-time Wynne Prize finalist, Sweaney has captured a house shuttered and still, awaiting its fate.",False,data/images/2025_Robyn Sweaney_The red zone.jpg,2025_Robyn Sweaney_The red zone,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30873/

Modelled entirely in white, leaning in to the wall, she stands on a table supported by a single elephant trunk. The work and its title suggest the presence of an elephant in the room – something obvious that people are unwilling to discuss. The elephant ‘might be desire … consent … a sculptural concern of great weight in the history of art … the heart laid bare,’ says Swann, leaving it open to interpretation. A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Swann is interested in the broad complexities of our human condition, and especially ‘the intensity of emotions and passions, our deep longing, our desire, our sensuousness and our sensuality’. Her recent sculptures have explored female figures in classical Greek sculpture and mythology, including tales of seduction and sexual violence.

They remind us that, like a well-tended garden, friendships require care and attention, but the rewards are boundless.’ A first-time Wynne Prize finalist who is also a finalist in the 2025 Archibald Prize, Srivilasa honours his cherished circle of friends by adorning this figurative sculpture with small characters that ‘symbolise the warmth and companionship that enrich life’. These are the ‘silent allies’ of his title – people to keep close during difficult times. The character’s fingers form ‘V’ signs as ‘a universal gesture of peace, friendship and happiness,’ Srivilasa explains. ‘Despite the challenges we face, we can find solace and strength in our connections with others. By including this symbol, I want to convey that everything is okay, and that together, we can create a peaceful and joyful world.’",False,data/images/2025_Vipoo Srivilasa_Silent allies.jpg,2025_Vipoo Srivilasa_Silent allies,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30871/
2025,Michael Snape,Witness,carved cedar wood,"Michael Snape took up woodcarving as a quieter alternative to steel work. After several decades of working with metal, he found the change liberating. ‘The use of steel allows for an open sculpture. Carving is a closed and contained form,’ he explains. ‘The wood registers more immediately the presence of the hand and the emotion.’ Snape’s Witness is larger than life and expressively hand hewn. He carved the sculpture using an axe, a tool that he found productively limiting in its lack of precision. Over the space of a year, Snape worked at the wood block to reveal its sculptural form, explaining, ‘This work has been inspired by the challenge of carving a human figure today. Does she or “they” have an individual identity? Are they strong or weak? Are they young or old or idealised? As a witness, this sculpture stands silently, listening and watching and waiting.’ Snape is also a finalist in the 2025 Sulman Prize.

The central slice suggests a world of division and change, in contrast with the serenity of Silver’s expression, his closed eyes giving the impression of dreaming or being lost in thought. Although the cut appears to have occurred in an instant, the action was ‘executed with slow precision over many hours,’ Silver explains, from a plasticine cast that was later rendered in concrete. The work carries the sensation of this gesture and appears to still be in the process of splitting. Silver’s twist on the art historical tradition of bust sculpture, often used to honour important figures, pushes the boundaries of the portraiture genre.",False,data/images/2025_Tim Silver_Untitled _splitting_ _3.jpg,2025_Tim Silver_Untitled _splitting_ _3,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30869/

The first-time Wynne Prize finalist says she wanted to avoid sculptural traditions that ‘cast women as passive, decorative and functional objects’, and found a way to revisit the vessel on her own terms. Russell’s work is built by piping bright-coloured porcelain slip in a style reminiscent of cake decorating and domestic handicrafts – decorative arts often associated with women. By embracing an aesthetic that is labour-intensive but traditionally undervalued, she highlights ‘the vulnerability and resilience of women’s histories’. ‘The intricate surfaces of my vessels represent layers of strength, care and complexity, but also the risk of unravelling under pressure,’ says Russell. Ancient ceramic traditions are influential for Russell, who describes Greek loutrophoros water carriers and works depicting women as ‘figures of reverence’ as key inspirations. This sculpture references multicoloured funerary urns made in the Canosa region of southern Italy around 400–300 BCE . For Russell, these are not only functional objects, ‘but sites of storytelling, myth-making and cultural identity’ that she revisits through a contemporary feminist lens.",False,data/images/2025_Ebony Russell_Polychrome loutrophoros gesture of revealing in blue.jpg,2025_Ebony Russell_Polychrome loutrophoros gesture of revealing in blue,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30868/

Australia, trading nation: still doing what it must despite US tariffs; still in the business of transportation.’ For three-time Wynne finalist Jude Rae, this view towards Sydney’s Botany Bay, or Kamay, is laden with its history as the birthplace of colonial Australia. Her sightline from the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern to the site of Captain Cook’s first landing in Australia, a place deemed terra nullius (no man’s land) by the British, was also a traditional corridor used by Aboriginal people to access the bay. Rae devotes her canvas to an immense sky underlaid with the rust reds of impending sunrise. ‘There is something compelling about the constantly flashing gantry lights and the floodlights blasting away in those hours just before dawn,’ she says, ‘all rendered puny under the heavenly expanse of that vast southern sky.’",True,data/images/2025_Jude Rae_Pre-dawn sky over Port Botany container terminal.jpg,2025_Jude Rae_Pre-dawn sky over Port Botany container terminal,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30867/

The effects of these tests were severe and have had lasting impacts on Aṉangu. She uses a vibrant red to represent the poison from the bombs and the internal grey to refer to the smoke. The texture and detailed depictions on the exterior form includes punu (trees), circling toxic winds, and Aṉangu gathering in a wiltja (shelter).

Powditch, a 12-time Wynne finalist, says the table with its white central marking ‘screamed landscape at me for 25 years’, compelling him to transform it into a horizon line dividing ‘land and sky … a Big Country!’ In the bottom-right corner, a small figure on horseback with two dogs gazes up at the imposing text, hinting at other interpretations. ‘Is it a signpost? A tourist attraction like the Big Banana?’ Powditch asks. ‘Or is it a statement of claim or home? And if so, by whom? Invader or invaded? Perhaps it’s a warning that what lies beyond is not the green familiarity of “the country” as the English rider would know it.’ Powditch highlights how this seemingly simple term ‘means different things to different people/s’ and especially in Australia, as a geographically ‘big country’ where understandings of land and landscape continue to evolve.",False,data/images/2025_James Powditch_Big country.jpg,2025_James Powditch_Big country,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30865/

Kenny Pittock has  faithfully re-created its A-frame shape and pictographic figure, but replaced its expected message of warning with an invitation to ‘throw caution to the wind’. Pittock says this piece ‘speaks to both personal and global anxiety, and the tension between our desire for control and the freedom that can be found in letting go’. Pondering these ideas of restraint and release, he finds possibility in ‘the beauty of imperfection and the courage to move forward despite the uncertainty ahead.’ A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Pittock based his work on a fold-out sign that he used in a former job as a supermarket cleaner. Unlike the plastic, mass-produced original, this sculpture was made slowly by casting and hand-painting heavy bronze. Pittock has given it ‘more weight, both conceptually and physically,’ acting on his desire to elevate the seemingly mundane object.

Her painting Echoes of home captures a glimpse of a house in Cabramatta West, close to where O’Donnell grew up. ‘I am drawn to the architecture of the area, particularly Liverpool and its surrounding suburbs,’ she says. ‘The old housing commission homes with the fibro cladding will always conjure up a feeling of home.’ O’Donnell works predominantly in charcoal and pencil to create meticulously observed drawings of urban architecture. Having recently embraced oil paint, she brings a similarly analytical eye to her canvases, cropping and distilling the essence of her source material to ‘reframe the familiar’. While her works are absent of people, O’Donnell is careful to note the human presence in her scenes, whether it be an open window or a partially raised blind.

2025,Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran,Seated figure with brown spiky mask,"earthenware, stoneware, glaze, lustre, epoxy resin, beads, tassels","This seated ceramic figure continues Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran’s exploration of deities and their cultural significance. Elements reference his Sri Lankan ancestry, including a head which channels yaka mask designs. These cultural adornments ‘embody and reflect spirits, deities and demons while being tools for storytelling, healing and exorcism,’ the first-time Wynne finalist says. He is interested in the histories of masks and their symbolic uses across ritual, performance and protest as ‘mechanisms of power, concealment and polymorphism’. The figure’s body is inspired by sculptures from Buddhism and Hinduism – religions that have long coexisted in Sri Lanka – some of which Nithiyendran first saw as a child roaming through the Hindu temple in Westmead, Western Sydney. Its white drapery has a Graeco-Roman sensibility that also recalls ancient Buddhist sculptures from Gandhara (encompassing parts of present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan), revealing Nithiyendran’s interest in cross-cultural contact and the global circulation of figurative sculpture. Subtler references to emojis and other contemporary symbols also feature in the work.

2025,Lorna Napanangka,Untitled,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This is Marrapinti, an important rock hole site west of the Pollock Hills in Western Australia. A group of ancestral women once camped at Marrapinti when travelling east. While at the site, the women made nose bones, which are worn through a hole made in the septum. Also known as marrapinti, these objects are now only worn by the older generation during ceremonial occasions. Lorna Napanangka is a senior Pintupi artist who began painting through Papunya Tula Artists in the 1990s, alongside several other Pintupi women. In recent years, the two-time Wynne finalist has radically transformed her visual language while transitioning from using a watiya (painting stick) to a paintbrush. Napanangka uses large, soft brushes to build up layers of dotted linework, creating rich and nebulous compositions that serve as an expressive meditation on place.",False,data/images/2025_Lorna Napanangka_Untitled.jpg,2025_Lorna Napanangka_Untitled,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30861/
2025,Vincent Namatjira,King Dingo,6 panels: synthetic polymer paint and oil stick on board,"Vincent Namatjira is a celebrated artist working through Iwantja Arts in Indulkana, Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia, known for his portraiture and, more recently, depictions of Country. Inspired by the work of his great-grandfather Albert Namatjira, Vincent Namatjira has painted multiple locations of significance to Western Aranda people on individual boards. These have been pieced together to showcase the ghostly qualities of the gum trees and the rich hues that characterise this landscape. Over these landscapes, Namatjira has placed a dingo, a native animal that has been villainised as a pest and predator. Here, he reimagines and elevates this animal to an icon – one that will undoubtedly be recognised across Australia. ‘I’ve painted the dingo as a symbol of Indigenous power,’ Namatjira explains. ‘King Dingo represents Aboriginal strength, pride and resilience, and respect for Country, culture, and Indigenous leadership past and present.’ The two-time Wynne finalist won the Archibald Prize in 2020 for his portrait of Adam Goodes, and is a finalist in the 2025 Archibald Prize with a self-portrait.",False,data/images/2025_Vincent Namatjira_King Dingo.jpg,2025_Vincent Namatjira_King Dingo,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30860/
2025,Marrnyula Munuŋgurr,The portal,natural pigments on bark,"Marrnyula Munuŋgurr is the daughter of celebrated artists Djutjadjutja Munuŋgurr and Noŋgirrŋa Marawili. An important artist in her own right, Munuŋgurr has been refining her practice over many decades. Due to declining eyesight, she has recently made a dramatic shift in painting style, embracing broad brushstrokes in stark contrast to her earlier fine-lined works. In The portal , Munuŋgurr deliberately draws on her mother’s painting style to depict the site of Wäṉḏawuy. An inland freshwater place where rivers meet, this is the ancestral homeland for the Djapu clan that Munuŋgurr belongs to and is the place where the spirits of the Djapu pass between the dimensions of the physical and the spiritual. ‘I paint the freshwater where the Shark ancestor rushed up and hit its head on the fish trap which halted its journey at the place called Wäṉḏawuy,’ explains Munuŋgurr. ‘These are the designs for those waters. Can you see the white clay design? That is the water, the clear water. And the black design in the middle, that is the muddy water produced by the shark thrashing about. And this design goes straight towards Wäṉḏawuy.’ Munuŋgurr’s work is included in the exhibition Yolŋu power: the art of Yirrkala , presented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ Naala Badu building from 21 June to 6 October 2025.",False,data/images/2025_Marrnyula Munuŋgurr_The portal.jpg,2025_Marrnyula Munuŋgurr_The portal,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30859/
2025,Betty Muffler,Ngangkaṟi Ngura – healing Country,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"Three-time Wynne Prize finalist Betty Muffler has recently begun experimenting with the negative space in her paintings. The intense black base she uses, paired with intricate white markings, evokes her Country’s rocky terrain and her birthplace, Yalungu, while tracking the movements of emus. Muffler’s designs encode her knowledge as a ngangkaṟi (healer) and her connection to her father’s spirit, the eagle, that she uses to travel the lands at night in her sleep to heal others. Muffler shares, ‘Ngayuku ngura, Maralinga munu ngayuku ngura, Yalungu. Uwa Yalungunya ngayuku! Emu tjuta ngaranyi. Emu tjuta. Emu tjuta paluru tjana ngaranyi. Apungka. Apu.

There are emus there, a group of emus, alive in the site. It’s rocky, it’s in rockhill country. Over that side is Maralinga, where the smoke came from. The smoke from the bomb testing.

2025,Nicola Moss,City and nature – Darling Harbour,synthetic polymer paint and paper on linen,"Gold Coast–based artist Nicola Moss recently visited the Chinese Garden of Friendship in Sydney. Located in the inner-city suburb of Darling Harbour, the small green space was built in 1988 to mark Australia’s bicentenary and symbolises a diplomatic friendship between Sydney and the Chinese city of Guangzhou. Moss is fascinated by the layers of meaning in such places, where town planning, heritage and culture intersect with maintenance regimes, leisure and the tranquillity of the natural world. ‘As we adapt to increasing temperatures, I am thinking about how plants contribute to creating liveable city environments. I believe sustainable green spaces are vital for our wellbeing, both physical and mental,’ she says. To create her works, Moss paints detailed patterns and loose brush marks onto paper, then builds her composition through intricately arranged cut-out shapes. Memorable features such as a single bonsai plant and swaying willow branches have been selected to convey an immediate impression of the garden, while dancing circles represent the positive energy she feels while visiting. This is her first time as a Wynne Prize finalist.",False,data/images/2025_Nicola Moss_City and nature _ Darling Harbour.jpg,2025_Nicola Moss_City and nature _ Darling Harbour,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30857/
2025,"Sanné
 Mestrom",Maternal cosmos,"concrete, bronze","One arm projecting towards the sky, the other holding aloft a bronze sun, Sanné Mestrom’s concrete figure is poised in a dynamic stance. A smaller bronze figure resides in the hollow of its body – ‘both child and child–self,’ says Mestrom. The inwardly curling infant and outwardly reaching mother ‘create a visual dialogue about connection and individuality within the parent–child relationship,’ she adds. Mestrom’s practice references figurative sculpture of the 20th century with its modernist simplifications of the body and the use of smooth, curvilinear forms. In Maternal cosmos , the figure’s cast concrete limbs in soft shades of pink and green are flecked with a terrazzo inlay, reminiscent of art deco interiors and Italian design. Mestrom lives in the Blue Mountains and is a finalist in the Wynne Prize for the first time in 2025. Her work explores the ways in which Western art history and culture place meaning upon women’s bodies. ‘While modernist masters often fragmented and objectified the female nude, Maternal cosmos reclaims the female form as a site of agency and creation rather than passive display,’ she says – ‘not as a fragmented object but as an integrated site of connection and nurturing.’",False,data/images/2025_Sanné__ Mestrom_Maternal cosmos.jpg,2025_Sanné__ Mestrom_Maternal cosmos,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30856/

Since settling in Yirrkala in the north-eastern tip of the Northern Territory in 2022, she has dedicated herself to painting full-time at Buku-Larrŋgay Mulka Centre. Using a distinct palette of pastel tones, Marawili has painted a significant location on Country where she was taught how to harvest native plant medicines by her mother. ‘This is my place,’ explains Marawili. ‘It is at my homeland of Yilpara, also known as Bäniyala. Close to Bäniyala is an area on the fringe of the jungle where some important plants grow. It is called Gurraŋandji. If someone is sick, I get some women together and we come here to gather the medicine. ‘In the late dry season this area is decorated with the white lily flowers: wärrkarr,’ says Marawili. ‘This is the time when the wind from the north, Luŋgurrma, and the wind from the south, Maḏirriny, are bumping into each other. You can see this in the background design. The lightweight fruit of the nhumurray have been blown towards the beach.’ Marawili’s work is included in the exhibition Yolŋu power: the art of Yirrkala , presented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ Naala Badu building from 21 June to 6 October 2025.",False,data/images/2025_Yalmakany Marawili_Murrtjumun_ nhumurray_ wärrkarr_ butjiriŋaniŋ.jpg,2025_Yalmakany Marawili_Murrtjumun_ nhumurray_ wärrkarr_ butjiriŋaniŋ,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30854/

Employing domestic fabrics such as vintage wool blankets as a base, McLauchlan uses eucalyptus and wattle leaves, possum pelts, and cotton thread to dye, print and embroider large sculptural works in the form of blankets and necklaces. In Kamilaroi culture, wabuwi is the name given to a mercurial spirit figure who has influence over weather patterns and the elements. The size of McLauchlan’s necklace suggests that it is not made at a human scale but instead represents a larger-than-life spirit figure. Both familiar and uncanny, the materials of the necklace combine to suggest anatomical structures such as umbilical cords and digestive tracts. McLauchlan believes that both objects and places retain memories, creating richly associative works that celebrate the fundamental gift of life and the shared moments of meaning that unite us across time.",False,data/images/2025_Juanita McLauchlan_wabuwi _ weather spirit.jpg,2025_Juanita McLauchlan_wabuwi _ weather spirit,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30855/
2025,Tessa MacKay,Final sunset on the beach... bye holiday!.jpg,oil on paper,"Tessa MacKay is fascinated by the host of ‘low-value’ images uploaded to 2000s-era Facebook. At a time when digital photography converged with online image-sharing, users uploaded photos with an abandon almost unthinkable when considering the hyper-curated nature of social media platforms today. ‘I know very little about the physical location depicted in the painting, except that the digital source image, which came from a user on Facebook, included a caption hinting it was taken during a holiday,’ says MacKay. ‘I was drawn to the somewhat failed attempt to capture a gorgeous beach sunset, whereby the camera’s flash blasted the snacks (and their reflective packaging) with white light, leaving the beach setting underexposed.’ Applying oil paint in thin layers to build detail, MacKay faithfully emulated the source photo’s digital artefacts. The slender outlines of sharpened haloes, the degradation of file compression and the blown-out brightness of highlight clipping are achieved by MacKay through pointillism, scumbling and layers of glaze.",False,data/images/2025_Tessa MacKay_Final sunset on the beach___ bye holiday__jpg.jpg,2025_Tessa MacKay_Final sunset on the beach___ bye holiday__jpg,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30853/
2025,Alfred Lowe,Lone dancer,hand-built stoneware with underglaze sgraffito and raffia,"Lone dancer is the largest work made to date in Alfred Lowe’s ongoing series All dressed up . A self-taught artist working through the APY Art Centre Collective’s Tarntanya/Adelaide studio, Lowe is interested in investigating themes of beauty and the human pursuit of perfection. His work compares idealised self-presentation to imperfections found in the natural world. ‘We try to present ourselves to the world as flawless, but when you look at the natural world like the mountains in Central Australia, it is the flaws that create beauty,’ explains Lowe. Bold, colourful and unapologetically expressive, Lone dancer commands attention. Lowe considers the work to be joyfully defiant of perfection. ‘Its presence rejects expectations, ignores preconceptions and embraces joy,’ says Lowe. ‘You can love the work or hate the work, but you can’t ignore it.’ Black raffia, inspired by cultural adornments, spills from the centre of the work, reflecting Lowe’s interest in navigating culture and identity in contemporary contexts.

2025,Elizabeth Kunoth Kngwarray,Yam seeds,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"Elizabeth Kunoth Kngwarray depicts aspects of Aharlper in Utopia in the Northern Territory in this painting. The work was created at her home at Iylenty, some 360 kilometres north-east of Mparntwe/Alice Springs. As a cultural custodian, Kngwarray is concerned with transmitting stories and ceremony through her artworks, preserving and continuing her community’s rich cultural practices. To complete this work, Kngwarray, a three-time Wynne finalist, laid her canvas flat on the ground, applying paint with bottles of varying nib sizes to produce intricate flicks of colour. These ‘flicks’ reference the yam, a native food plant and medicinal source. The yam’s low, sprawling form is evoked through the electrifying reds and blues Kngwarray has applied in varying intensities to create dynamic pools of colour that spread across the canvas. Interspersed among these bold hues are tiny flecks of white, yellow and teal. They shimmer and glint, similar to how the yam’s seeds and flowers gently move when a breeze brushes past the plant.",False,data/images/2025_Elizabeth Kunoth Kngwarray_Yam seeds.jpg,2025_Elizabeth Kunoth Kngwarray_Yam seeds,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30851/

Here, she depicts the landscape around Alkanyuṉta and Kuḻi within the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands in South Australia, along with the Seven Sisters story. The Seven Sisters story is a recurrent theme within Ken’s paintings and was passed to her when she was a tjitji (child) by her family who are the traditional owners for significant sites where the tale takes place. ‘I listen to the old people’s stories,’ says Ken, ‘when they are talking about tjukurpa and telling creation stories.’ Seven Sisters , with its rich, shifting colours, affirms the importance of this place and story. Ken explains, ‘I use colour kutjara – dotting with two colours – to beautifully layer and join parts of my painting together.’ She has captured the journey of the characters, where the oldest sister shepherds the younger sisters to safety, away from the anti-hero, Wati Nyiru.",False,data/images/2025_Sylvia Ken_Seven Sisters.jpg,2025_Sylvia Ken_Seven Sisters,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30850/
2025,Mehwish Iqbal,Zameen muqaddas (sacred earth),watercolour and ink on handmade paper,"This work ‘reflects the eclectic beauty of Australia’s bush landscapes,’ says Mehwish Iqbal, ‘honouring the resilience of the land and its remarkable capacity to sustain and flourish in even the harshest conditions’. Across multiple sheets of handmade paper, intricate renderings of plant life appear among pools of ink, as though swirling between order and collapse. For Iqbal, a Pakistan-born artist now living in Sydney, this contrast evokes ‘the aftermath of bushfires – symbolising both destruction and renewal. From the ashes, new life emerges.’ She has used Persian siāh-qalam (black brushwork and ink) painting techniques to show the structure and integrity of each plant in meticulous detail, celebrating nature’s diversity and collective strength. A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Iqbal says her art ‘embraces the spiritual philosophy that the earth is a living entity – an organism that, much like humans, has the ability to listen, breathe, and create memories of its own’.",False,data/images/2025_Mehwish Iqbal_Zameen muqaddas _sacred earth_.jpg,2025_Mehwish Iqbal_Zameen muqaddas _sacred earth_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30849/
2025,Charles Jangala Inkamala,West side Hermannsburg (Ntaria),synthetic polymer paint on canvas,"Charles Jangala Inkamala has depicted an important cultural site found towards the western part of Tjoritja/MacDonnell Ranges, near Mparntwe/Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. This is his father’s Country and a place where he has spent considerable time learning the land: how the rocks are layered, how the trees grow and how the light shifts and changes colours across the divide. For Inkamala, this site has deep cultural significance as it has been shaped by ancient forces embedded in the landscape that teach Arrernte people law and stories today. He encourages viewers to feel the strength and spirit of this place. Inkamala works through the Bindi Mwerre Anthurre Artists studio in Mparntwe, where he has established his idiosyncratic painting style and approach. He gravitates towards vibrant colours like ultramarine blue that give depth to his uniquely constructed landscapes, their compositions bending and moving between perspectives.

Promptly photographing and videoing the scene on his phone, he shared it to an Instagram story, then paused. How often do we experience the natural world indirectly, through screens? With Zeitgeist , HEGO playfully acknowledges this phenomenon, and knows that viewers will engage with his artwork in a way that confirms this status quo: by photographing it and sharing it online. Interested in readymade sculptures and working with found objects, the artist was inspired to paint on an old phone screen after running out of canvas. While art can imitate nature, HEGO maintains that some things are impossible to re-create: ‘scale and temperature, feet in the grass, ocean spray, morning sunrise’. ‘I challenge you to walk outside and experience nature in real life,’ he says, ‘and walk inside an art gallery and see art in real life too.’",False,data/images/2025_HEGO_Zeitgeist.jpg,2025_HEGO_Zeitgeist,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30847/

My grandparents’ garden occupies a place in my mind kept only for magical childhood things – a haze of whipbirds, infinite pathways and cicada shells,’ says two-time Wynne finalist Eliza Gosse. Like a threshold to another time, Gosse’s sun-warmed landscape centres on a mid-century Australian home and garden born of her imagination. The painting references images from past copies of Australian House & Garden magazine and is inspired by memories of her grandparents’ home in Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. Gosse celebrates the creativity and abundance of the cultivated Australian backyard in this work, depicting it in harmony with the plant and birdlife of the bush. ‘They took so much care and pride in [their garden] – something I feel our generation may have lost,’ she says. Painted in stylised forms that allude to popular culture and contemporary design, Flannel flowers under the wattle tree preserves a present-day longing for the past.",False,data/images/2025_Eliza Gosse_Flannel flowers under the wattle tree.jpg,2025_Eliza Gosse_Flannel flowers under the wattle tree,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30846/
2025,Joe Frost,Cumberland / Wallumatta and Wanne,synthetic polymer paint on polyester,"Joe Frost’s paintings are built up slowly in layers, large brushstrokes adding wet washes over dry. Like the ever-changing topography of the urban environment, Frost’s canvases undergo gradual transformations as he works. A first-time Wynne Prize finalist, Frost has been drawing and painting Western Sydney’s Cumberland Plain for three decades. He says, ‘I was born in the steep hills that I now know to have been Wallumatta [in Eastwood] and, from an early age, was fascinated by the wide view onto the industrialised plain of Wanne [south, across the Parramatta River]. I found myself as a painter by depicting this area. It dwells within me.’ Across the work’s surface zags the Parramatta River, the main tributary of Sydney Harbour that runs out to the city’s west. Fascinated by the area’s industrial history, including the departure of the American chemicals manufacturer Union Carbide in the late 1980s, Frost finds stimulation even in ‘the sadness of these poisoned places’ – inspired by memories of their abandoned forms and open spaces.",False,data/images/2025_Joe Frost_Cumberland _ Wallumatta and Wanne.jpg,2025_Joe Frost_Cumberland _ Wallumatta and Wanne,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30845/

It’s my Bunnings, my hardware store, my museum. This place is alive with story. It’s full of things people think are useless – scrap metal, burnt-out cars, old tyres – but I see memory in every bit of it.’ ‘This painting is connected to my earlier photographic series Graveyards in between ,’ says Fielding. It was painted specifically for this year’s Wynne Prize. ‘Last year, when I was a finalist, I saw so many paintings of landscapes that felt stuck in the past – empty places, like no one ever lived there. That’s not the truth of this country. This is my response, my challenge.’ Fielding is a two-time Wynne finalist and is exhibiting across all three prizes in 2025. At the heart of his practice is a desire to encourage viewers to ‘see’ Country.

Walking along the outskirts of a friend’s farm near the creek one day, Stephen Evans explains, ‘this body of water asked me to take a seat and have a mindful conversation’. He sat on the bank to paint the scene in a small concertina sketchbook. ‘It was a peaceful place,’ says the first-time Wynne finalist, who was struck by ‘the sunlight and reflection of eucalypts along with the stillness of the creek’. Carrying portable, compact art-making materials allows the Sydney-based artist to spontaneously capture everyday scenes as he encounters them.

The property belongs to her friend Charlie Maslin, a regenerative farmer who was also the subject of an Archibald Prize entry by Culliton in 2020. Of the property, she says, ‘Livestock are rotated in cell paddocks so the grass has long breaks from the wear and tear of animals. Charlie has built leaky weirs on the creek so large ponds hold water longer in dry times. Grasses and reeds grow along the edges of the banks so erosion isn’t an issue. All good farming practices, in my mind.’ A nine-time Wynne Prize finalist, Culliton takes an expansive view of the undulating landscape but also dwells in detail on blades of grass and dimpled clouds.

Outside, there was a frost. Inside, I was in a cloud of warm breath.’ Cross, a two-time Wynne Prize finalist, has painted Walbunja Country, or Braidwood in NSW . He is an artist often described as being interested in the collisions of materials, ideas and histories. The beauty of his work, with its atmospheric evocations of morning light, is juxtaposed with the harshness of the repurposed timber he has painted on.

2025,Cybele Cox,Baubo column,"earthenware-fired raku clay, glaze, lustre, epoxy resin","This statuesque work by Cybele Cox depicts the goddess Baubo, a character from Greek mythology. Early depictions of Baubo include second- and third-century- BCE terracotta figurines with heads that sit directly atop their legs. The goddess is a minor yet critical figure in the story of Demeter, the goddess of grains and harvest who falls into despair following the abduction of her daughter Persephone, and turns the land cold and barren. Only the dancing comic Baubo can cheer Demeter, restoring her will to find her daughter and beckon spring. This pearlescent large-scale sculpture honours the magical Baubo as a figure of ‘female power, friendship, laughter and unbridled freedom of expression,’ Cox says. She appears as a three-sided column to reference classical architecture and ideas of harmony associated with trios – including mind-body-soul and birth-life-death connections. ‘Much of my work is predicated on fantasy, tapping into the richness of the imagination,’ explains the first-time Wynne Prize finalist. Her Baubo stands on a laughing head as a playful expression of feminine strength.",False,data/images/2025_Cybele Cox_Baubo column.jpg,2025_Cybele Cox_Baubo column,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30839/

The area he depicts is part of the Stuart Ranges, just north of Coober Pedy. ‘This is a place I know well,’ says Cooley. ‘I’ve visited it many times since my early teens.’ Cooley has worked from memory to paint this location, the spectacular coloured hills and flat-topped mesas of the Kangu-Breakaways Conservation Park. He uses an aerial viewpoint to increase the sense of vastness and builds up rich layers of paint with a palette knife to celebrate the extraordinary beauty of landscape and how the colourful hills transform under different light. The work also draws from his many years of prospecting for opals out on the land. Cooley works between the Umoona Community Art Centre in Coober Pedy and the APY Art Centre Collective’s Tarntanya/Adelaide studio.

2025,Casey Chen,Military maneuvers 7 (after Rousseau),"glazed earthenware tiles, overglaze enamels, gold lustre, wood, grout","‘I wanted to convey dense, lush greenery in a figurative landscape,’ Casey Chen says of this painted ceramic work portraying a military fortress under attack. The scene is loosely modelled on depictions of China’s Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) by artist Wu Youru (1840–93), considered one of the first Chinese cartoonists. Rather than focus on the battle, Chen details the surrounding landscape, where pointer dogs observe the fire and smoke from outside the stronghold’s walls, dwarfed by plants and red peonies in the foreground and mountains in the distance. Chen’s inspirations include the jungle paintings of French artist Henri Rousseau, Dutch Delftware tiles and hunting scenes in medieval tapestries. His ceramics explore East Asian porcelain craft techniques and are decorated with an eclectic mix of traditional and contemporary motifs. In many of his vibrant works, references from Chinese literature, mythology and folklore merge with characters from pop culture, including the Japanese animations and American cartoons Chen watched as a child.

2025,Armando Chant,Aura,"linen thread, pigment and binder on linen","In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, stereoscopes were popular devices for viewing landscape photographs in ‘three dimensions’. Two stereoscopic photographs – taken side by side to imitate the distance between the eyes – could be viewed simultaneously to give the illusion of depth. Armando Chant used the ‘otherworldly’ negatives from vintage stereoscopes to make Aura , enlarging, layering and drawing over the images to create an imagined landscape that retained the scratches and stains of the glass originals. Chant then worked with artisans in New Delhi to translate his composition into embroidery by hand. He completed the process of material transformation by reworking the surface with pigment washes, subtly evoking light and the ephemeral weather conditions of mist and fog. For two-time Wynne finalist Chant, these composite landscapes are images that we can all connect with: ‘The work is not about depicting a specific place, but through processes of erasure and negation an essence of place can be created and revealed.’ Chant acknowledges the contributions of artisans Mohammed Waseem, Mohammed Irfan, Mohammed Imran, Mohammed Fahim and Mohammed Tasleem for the embroidery on this work.",False,data/images/2025_Armando Chant_Aura.jpg,2025_Armando Chant_Aura,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30840/
2025,Mark Maurangi Carrol,Song palm (stay forever),oil enamel and permanent marker on linen,"‘This work brings together several landscapes from my childhood,’ says Mark Maurangi Carrol, a first-time Wynne Prize finalist. ‘Instead of showing one specific site, the painting merges elements from different locations into a single, imagined scene. It is made from fragments – what I remember, what’s been lost and what still lingers.’ Carrol explains that he is interested in how memory shapes and informs how we understand a landscape. ‘Over time, details fade or shift, but the emotional connection remains,’ he says. ‘This painting reflects that process – how familiar places can become abstract or unclear. I wanted it to feel both recognisable and distant.’ Carrol’s painting process is heavily inspired by pāreu (wraparound skirt) dying and staining, techniques he learned in Avaiki Nui/Cook Islands. He built this composition by stitching smaller pieces of linen together to make a canvas, then pushing pigments through the reverse side until it reached his desired level of colour saturation.",False,data/images/2025_Mark Maurangi Carrol_Song palm _stay forever_.jpg,2025_Mark Maurangi Carrol_Song palm _stay forever_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30835/
2025,Margaret Campbell,Minyma pulka (big woman),stoneware with underglaze and sgrafitto,"Margaret Campbell, a first-time Wynne finalist, has sculpted a naked woman sitting upright on a stool. Her body is unguarded, her gaze steady. This is Campbell’s self-portrait, but also a general expression of strong First Nations women. A Luritja artist from Warumpi/Papunya, currently working in Mparntwe/Alice Springs at the Bindi Mwerre Anthurre Artists studio, Campbell has been exploring self-portraiture since 2024. She is interested in giving form to the quiet embodied power of women who carry stories, Country and identity with them, no matter where they go. This work is heavily influenced by Campbell’s drawing practice and her research into depictions of women from varied sources, including coffee table–style art books and magazines. She is particularly interested in how clay as a medium can tell a story of identity that goes beyond appearance. By using material from the land, she infers that this woman quite literally holds Country within her.",False,data/images/2025_Margaret Campbell_Minyma pulka _big woman_.jpg,2025_Margaret Campbell_Minyma pulka _big woman_,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30834/
2025,Nyunmiti Burton,Seven Sisters,synthetic polymer paint on linen,"This expansive landscape, built up with walka-walka (dotting), depicts the breadth of Amata in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands: from Atila/Mount Connor to Walinynga/Cave Hill, across to Alkanyunta and Kuḻi on the other side. This is home for three-time Wynne Prize finalist Nyunmiti Burton, but also part of the Seven Sisters story. ‘The sisters, they came through and travelled from Atila to Kuḻi, escaping from Wati Nyiru,’ she explains. ‘In the story, it is the oldest sister, and her leadership, that guides the sisters from the dangers of the world.’ Burton returns to this story each time she paints, and she enjoys experimenting with colour and composition. ‘I made this work especially for the Wynne Prize,’ she shares. This work is also a homage to the late Kunmanara Brady, who worked alongside Burton in the APY Art Centre Collective’s studio in Tarntanya/Adelaide. ‘She loved using these colours and I was thinking about her and remembering her when I made this work,’ says Burton.",False,data/images/2025_Nyunmiti Burton_Seven Sisters.jpg,2025_Nyunmiti Burton_Seven Sisters,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30833/
2025,Harriette Bryant,Maralinga,"synthetic polymer paint, PVC glue and inkjet print on found silver platter","The bomb comes down and makes a big mess. It melts the sand, shakes the earth, poisons the ground. They bury it, but it’s still there – in the dust, in the water, in our memory. The story is still going on, that’s why I keep talking about it, so we can always remember. – Harriette Bryant First-time Wynne Prize finalist Harriette Bryant transforms objects that carry connotations of colonial domesticity into powerful conduits for storytelling. Inspired by her elders’ stories and her own research, Bryant paints the history of nuclear testing at Maralinga, South Australia, between 1956 and 1963. She reminds us of the lingering after-effects of the bombs and the displacement still experienced by survivors and their descendants. ‘I painted this on a silver platter,’ Bryant says, ‘because that’s how they served it. Whitefellas watching from a distance, sipping tea, while Aṉangu ran.’ Under the gallery lights, this silver platter glimmers, in stark contrast to the black puyu or mist that is said to have moved across Country. Bryant’s commentary heavily implies that this is how the Australian Government served up Country to the British: on a silver platter.",False,data/images/2025_Harriette Bryant_Maralinga.jpg,2025_Harriette Bryant_Maralinga,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30832/
2025,Seth Birchall,Soft spoken and proud,oil on canvas,"While creating this painting, Seth Birchall was ‘thinking about the glade and orchard as garden spaces – sites of renewal and sustenance, safety and opportunity’. On daily walks to his studio on Wangal Country in Leichhardt, Sydney, the first-time Wynne finalist contemplated public and private spaces. ‘I was imagining the public land being used for food production instead of lawn and ornamental trees,’ he says, reflecting on how fruit trees were once planted along roadsides so that coach drivers had food for their journeys. ‘Then I started thinking about grace, hospitality, charity and the hurdles to this way of thinking.’ Birchall’s work is based on a combination of found imagery and personal memory, including his experiences of apple-picking, a tree in his childhood backyard and hikes across abandoned farms to collect fruit. The bountiful apple tree in this painting stands proud behind a fence, while the full moon hovering over a mountain in the distance gives the scene a sense of meditative tranquillity.",False,data/images/2025_Seth Birchall_Soft spoken and proud.jpg,2025_Seth Birchall_Soft spoken and proud,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30831/
2025,Natasha Bieniek,Microcosm,oil on wood,"Natasha Bieniek often paints pathways or bodies of water to guide viewers into her miniature worlds. In Microcosm , she depicts Fitzroy Gardens in Melbourne’s inner east, a Victorian-era garden of large elm trees, ornate flower beds and ornamental ponds. ‘By painting on such a tiny scale my intention is to create an opportunity for the viewer to engage closely with the scene, inviting them to take a moment to pause,’ she says. ‘We live in a culture that’s dominated by phones and technical devices. The hand-held scale of my painting reflects this, but also aims to reinforce an intimate and real-life experience.’ Drawn to gardens that coexist with major cities, Bieniek believes these landscapes are imperative for our wellbeing, providing respite from the pace of city life. Bieniek was the 2015 Wynne Prize winner and this is her fifth time as a finalist. She is also a finalist in the 2025 Archibald Prize with a portrait of artist Cressida Campbell.",False,data/images/2025_Natasha Bieniek_Microcosm.jpg,2025_Natasha Bieniek_Microcosm,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30830/

Kalaya tjina I been put him whole lot. Nyangatja, uwa tjukurpa palatja emu tjina ngura tjutangka. Ngura pulka, ngura miil-miilpa tjanampa.’ Baker shares that he paints everything connected to this place – the emu tracks, the story. Everything is important and connected. This collaborative painting by senior artist Baker and younger artist Eric Barney emphasises the value of opportunities for exchange between artists from different generations. Working together through Iwantja Arts in Indulkana, Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) Lands, South Australia, the artists have divided the work into panels to enable simultaneous creation. This allows Baker to sit with Barney, where they share stories through conversation and song. Barney has learned the significance of punu (trees) from Baker and other senior artists. Through visceral colours and a collaborative approach to composition, the artists create a captivating depiction of their home.",False,data/images/2025_Alec Baker_ Eric Barney_Ngura _ Country.jpg,2025_Alec Baker_ Eric Barney_Ngura _ Country,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30837/
2025,Billy Bain,From the area,"mid-fire clay, glaze, gold lustre; wooden football bench","Perched as guardians of their domain, with golden canines flashing, are six black panthers crafted by Billy Bain, a three-time Wynne Prize finalist who is in this year’s Archibald Prize. He uses these big cats as conduits to channel his feelings about his displacement from the traditional lands of his ancestors, the Boorooberongal people. One panther, notably adorned with a golden mask bearing the artist’s likeness, reinforces Bain’s connection to the mysterious Lithgow black panther – a creature whose existence has never been confirmed, despite claims of sightings over decades. Bain aligns himself with the elusive panther – strong, capable of blending into the shadows, yet undeniably present. Bain critically interrogates Australian identity by engaging with colonial narratives and subtly undermining them. In this case, he humorously alludes to the Penrith region as being defined by its association with the local football team, the Penrith Panthers, whose success is a source of regional pride. From the area simultaneously champions Indigenous resistance by referencing the American Black Panther Party, a political organisation that influenced Bla&lpar;c&rpar;k Power consciousness among Australian Indigenous peoples.",False,data/images/2025_Billy Bain_From the area.jpg,2025_Billy Bain_From the area,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30829/
2025,Holly Anderson,I was a light across an ocean,oil on board,"I was a light across an ocean was inspired by the view from Adder Rock on Minjerribah/North Stradbroke Island. There, Holly Anderson would watch the sun set over the ocean and see ‘glitter paths’, a phenomenon created by light reflecting off rippling water. Anderson was reminded of this shimmering effect one day when looking at the striped folds of her bedsheets in her Meanjin/Brisbane apartment. ‘I saw an affinity between the ocean’s patterns and the stripy bed’s patterns and a painterly potential to collapse the two together,’ she explains. Anderson has depicted a glitter path where a body might lie along the bed, observing ‘a connection between the eye and the landscape, the body and the world’. The scene is rendered with subtle paint colours applied with a brush the exact width as the stripes themselves. ‘I wanted this work to conjure certain optical effects of a landscape through an everyday object,’ says the first-time Wynne finalist, who here explores ‘how the impression of a landscape might continue to be felt long after we’ve left it’.",False,data/images/2025_Holly Anderson_I was a light across an ocean.jpg,2025_Holly Anderson_I was a light across an ocean,https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/2025/30828/
